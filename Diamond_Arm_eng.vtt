We bring you a Iive broadcast
from our sea port.

43
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.692
This snow-white Iiner
is to depart on its next cruise,

44
00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:35.425
carrying a Iarge contingent
of Soviet tourists

45
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.432
on a very fascinating voyage.

46
00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:40.436
- HeIIo!
- HeIIo.

47
00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.506
What is your name, pIease?

48
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.006
Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

49
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.541
- And what's your occupation?
- Senior bookkeeper.

50
00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:52.310
Is there something you wouId Iike
to say to our dear Iisteners

51
00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.750
before Ieaving
for this fascinating journey?

52
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.756
As a matter of fact,
I didn't want to go.

53
00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.450
I was about to buy my wife
a fur coat.

54
00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:05.597
The fur coat can wait.
It's more important to see the worId.

55
00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:09.599
He works day and night...
The fur coat can wait.

56
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.327
So you've never before...

57
00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.632
No. We never traveIIed farther
than Dubrovka.

58
00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.669
Is it your first trip abroad, too?

59
00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.846
- I'm not going.
- We've come to say goodbye to dad.

60
00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:26.544
Fish Street. That's an important
street there. The Chikanuk pharmacy.

61
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:27.981
LyoIik, I remember it aII.

62
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.915
Everything you do must Iook very
reaI. You faII down and swear...

63
00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.282
''Damned appIe!''
No... ''Damned meIon!''

64
00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.290
Keep that in mind!

65
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.863
The injury...
Everything shouId be true to Iife.

66
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.433
As our chief says, ''The most important
thing in our business is reaIism.''

67
00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.532
Happy Iandings, tourist!

68
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.319
No, don't...
Just go!

69
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.960
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

70
00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:16.530
- Is this Cabin 16?
- Yes, it's 16.

71
00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:17.669
Are you bunking here, too?

72
00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:19.771
Yes. I'm Gennady Petrovich Kozodoyev.

73
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.635
Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

74
00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.972
- I hope we'II become friends.
- Oh, I think so.

75
00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.707
- Are you bringing aIong souvenirs?
- No.

76
00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.850
- I have some here...
- Vodka?

MIKHAIL SVETLOV

78
00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:06.283
Day Seven
of this fascinating cruise...

79
00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.683
I Iove the song
about hares.

80
00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.757
Senya, it's not topicaI,
about hares!

81
00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.455
''IsIand of Bad Luck''!

82
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.642
AII covered with greenery,
AbsoIuteIy, stark,

83
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.473
Lies in our itinerary
An isIand of bad Iuck.

84
00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.854
There Iive the savages,
Poor, wretched guys,

85
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.991
Faces bear ravages,
But kind under disguise.

86
00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.562
Whatever they're doing,
It never goes right.

87
00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.498
They must be born to ruin
On a very bIack Friday night.

88
00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.143
CrocodiIes not caught,
Coconuts won't grow.

89
00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.712
They weep and pray to God
For days and days in a row.

90
00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:17.620
They are no idIers,
They couId have had a baII.

91
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.623
They ought to canceI Fridays
Once and for aII.

92
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:29.195
But, aIas, no caIendar
On the isIe, there's not!

93
00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:31.962
Every Iiving isIander
Just goes for a naught.

94
00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.703
But, aIas, no caIendar
On damn isIe, there's not!

95
00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:40.675
That's why poor savages,
From earIy morn tiII night,

96
00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.679
Counting their damages,
Lament over their pIight.

97
00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.477
The poor deviIs moan,
Cursing their fate.

98
00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.519
What year is unknown,
As is unknown the date.

99
00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.677
...FinaIIy, here is the Iast
port of caII

100
00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.975
before returning
to their motherIand...

101
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:13.863
Ladies and gentIemen, we're now
in what is caIIed the oId town.

102
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.943
During the ruIe of the great
Emperor Shumunshin-Shah the Third,

103
00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:23.675
on these heights,
the ImperiaI architects had buiIt

104
00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.579
a marveIous ensembIe,

105
00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.481
which incIuded a paIace, a mosque,

106
00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:32.818
a 1 ,200-bed harem,
and many other... simiIar deIights.

107
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.534
Have you gone crazy?

108
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.903
Something's wrong.
She wants me to go and see.

109
00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.481
Hey, no, no, impossibIe!

110
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.845
- What does she want?
- I'II teII you Iater.

111
00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.487
Lady, Senora, Frau, Miss,
it's out of the question.

112
00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:07.217
Russo turista, capito, moraIita!
Verstehen? That's it!

113
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.485
But what does she want?

114
00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:19.997
We are most gratefuI to you. It was
a very interesting excursion.

115
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.814
Attention, pIease!
Now everyone wiII be on his own.

116
00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:34.817
You can waIk around the town.

117
00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:40.323
But at five o'cIock sharp,
everyone must be back on board.

118
00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:41.824
See you Iater.

119
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.532
Guesha! Why are you Ieaving me
in the Iurch?

120
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.396
I didn't Ieave you. I was waiting.

121
00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:52.471
Let's go this way.

122
00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.359
Where's he?

123
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.928
Don't worry,
he'II come.

124
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.793
- The password is ''Damned meIon''?
- Damned meIon.

125
00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:28.373
Are you sure he's on the SS
''MikhaiI SvetIov''?

126
00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.239
We were assured that he was.

127
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.377
The ship is Ieaving in an hour!

128
00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:37.816
Shut up!

129
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.457
Sorry, I guess I Iost my temper.

130
00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.550
You know...

131
00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:14.986
Guesha!

132
00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:22.978
Excuse me, Miss...

133
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:38.797
Damned meIon!

134
00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.235
Damned meIon!

135
00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.682
- Russo?
- Yes.

136
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.441
- ''MikhaiI SvetIov''?
- Yes, yes.

137
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.455
Damned meIon.
Damned meIon...

138
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.767
What's wrong with him?

139
00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.964
It's a very bad sprain.
He's even Iost consciousness.

140
00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:14.973
Let's get down to work.

141
00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:38.850
Damned meIon!..

142
00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:41.857
''MikhaiI SvetIov''...

143
00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:16.817
Damned meIon!

144
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.626
Damned meIon!

145
00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:37.348
Russo?
''MikhaiI SvetIov''?

146
00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.850
Why didn't you use your brains?

147
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.215
But the other one gave the password
too. ''Damned meIon''.

148
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.861
There foIIows an untransIatabIe pIay
on words

149
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:53.293
with the use of IocaI idiomatic
expressions.

150
00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.928
Comrades, it's time!
The ship Ieaves in haIf an hour!

151
00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:24.821
Those idiots cIaimed
he was unconscious.

152
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.828
So the poor fooI has no idea
what's going on.

153
00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.966
That's perfect!

154
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.475
What's this?

155
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.484
Nothing. Just contraband items
someone's trying to smuggIe in.

156
00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:53.847
Don't worry.
CaIm down... Drink some of this.

157
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.718
I never touch the stuff.

158
00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:59.660
Haven't you read about it in ''House
and Home''? Doctors recommend it.

159
00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:03.232
It wiII caIm your nervous system
and soothe your arteries.

160
00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.671
Drink up.

161
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.842
Captain,
what do I do now?

162
00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:17.504
Nothing.
Just have fun and reIax.

163
00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:20.675
But don't breathe a word to anyone
about that contraband stuff.

164
00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:22.820
And if someone wants to know
what happened to my arm?

165
00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:27.823
Say you sIipped, feII down
and got a cIosed fracture.

166
00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:31.018
You were knocked out, and when you
came to, it was aIready in a cast.

167
00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.826
I sIipped, feII down,
a cIosed fracture.

168
00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.798
I was knocked out,
I came to - a pIaster cast.

169
00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:42.531
And don't worry,
I'II notify everyone concerned.

170
00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:43.975
Thank you very much.

171
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.275
Don't you remember a thing?

172
00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:51.976
Be carefuI!

173
00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:54.913
- Why? I remember very weII.
- You remember what?

174
00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:58.722
I sIipped...
got knocked out.

175
00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:01.483
When I came to, I had this cast.
That's aII!

176
00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:06.725
- I wish I feII instead of you.
- Thanks. That's nice of you, Guesha.

177
00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.227
PIease, take care of your arm, Senya.

178
00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.662
Nadia is going to be upset.

179
00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.862
''That's c'est Ia vie,''
as Frenchmen say.

180
00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.704
I'm sorry, friend!

181
00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:58.348
Are you finished? Must I go aIready?

182
00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:00.212
Yes, move aIong, you're in the way.

183
00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.654
- You're through with me?
- That's right.

184
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.988
CouId it be that the Captain didn't
notify the customs? What do I do now?

185
00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:19.832
There he is! The stuff is safe.
As safe as in a safe.

186
00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.302
And the key?

187
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.840
To quote our chief's immortaI words,
''Once a haIfwit aIways a haIfwit.''

188
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:29.674
- I don't get it.
- You'II get it. Let's go to the chief!

189
00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:45.757
Hands off me!

190
00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:10.854
- Where are we going?
- Home.

191
00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.561
So you had a Iook at some foreign
ports?

192
00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.894
Yes, foreign ports.

193
00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.867
Where shouId I go?
To the poIice? Or home?

194
00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:24.501
This is the way home.

195
00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:30.435
I didn't give him my address.
Where's he taking me?

196
00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.939
There's just one road here
that goes into the city.

197
00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:35.744
I want to go to Morskaya Street,
number 21 , apartment 9.

198
00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:39.884
entrance three, third fIoor.

199
00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:42.817
What's wrong with your arm?

200
00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:47.687
Why is he interested in my arm?
He Iooks suspicious.

201
00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:52.720
I sIipped, feII down, got knocked out,
came to aIready in a cast.

202
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.024
Excuse me, you're an amateur actor,
aren't you?

203
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.467
Yes, that's right.

204
00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:59.536
Why did I Iie to him?
Why did he ask me?

205
00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:02.901
He's trying to get information from
me. He Iooks more and more suspicious.

206
00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.670
Why did he turn there?
He shouId have kept going straight.

207
00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.643
The highway's bIocked for repairs.
We shouId make a detour.

208
00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:14.409
- Stop! Let's give them a Iift!
- I can't. It's against reguIations.

209
00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:17.987
He didn't pick up those girIs.
He's not a taxi driver. He's a bandit.

210
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.284
Why did you wait to teII him
who you were?

211
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.226
I wanted to check
if he's reaIIy fit for the job.

212
00:24:26.398 --> 00:24:28.298
Did he prove it?

213
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.992
He proved it, CoIoneI.
He's perfect!

214
00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:34.765
I never dreamed that he'd...

215
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.907
Hit you with the cast?

216
00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:38.573
Yes, sir!
I probabIy shouId have...

217
00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:40.938
No sense in it.
Does he agree?

218
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.679
He agrees.
But stiII, I think we might...

219
00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:44.816
No sense in it.

220
00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.575
- May I suggest...
- You may not!

221
00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:49.219
- Maybe you'II Iet me...
- Yes, do that.

222
00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.323
This operation is your baby.
Act as you see right.

223
00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:54.689
Now go on with your report.

224
00:24:54.993 --> 00:25:00.898
Yes, sir. When we became better
acquainted, I outIined our pIan...

225
00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:02.826
What do I do now?

226
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:05.970
Nothing. Live as usuaI.
They're going to bite the bait.

227
00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.534
They'II be watching you,
we'II be watching them.

228
00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:11.471
As soon as they try to get the cast,
we'II cIose the trap.

229
00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:14.769
Like I'm the Iive bait.
I know, I'm a fisherman myseIf.

230
00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:18.347
They might offer to pay a ransom,
but I can bargain too.

231
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:22.715
I don't think so. They're convinced
you don't know a thing.

232
00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:27.348
They'II want their goods back, without
paying and without your noticing.

233
00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:30.417
How can they take a pIaster cast off
without my noticing?

234
00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:35.862
I'm not sure how they'II try to do it,
but they can get you drunk,

235
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:38.298
drug you or knock you out.

236
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.735
It's no probIem to do it on someone
who's knocked out or even dead.

237
00:25:43.975 --> 00:25:45.306
Who's dead?

238
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.703
But I don't reaIIy think
it'II go that far.

239
00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:52.549
CouIdn't you Iet someone eIse

240
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:54.514
wear this pIaster cast
for a IittIe whiIe?

241
00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:58.583
WeII, you can aIways say no.

242
00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:01.624
No, I'm no coward,
I'm just afraid.

243
00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.155
Afraid I won't be abIe to do it.

244
00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:09.800
Every man can do many things,

245
00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:14.270
but, sadIy enough,
not everyone is aware of it.

246
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.465
That's right, it happens so often.

247
00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:19.337
Let's set up the Iiaison.

248
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.214
Now what are you doing,
Semyon Semyonovich?

249
00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:36.421
How are we going to organize it?
In case we must speak to you...

250
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:37.823
Come to my pIace.

251
00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.258
And when you must speak to us...

252
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.796
I'II caII a taxi and give my name.

253
00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:44.231
Then I'II come, or maybe my assistant.
Everything cIear?

254
00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:50.841
Thanks very, very much.
And I'm sorry I was so...

255
00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.444
Forget it, we've seen much worse.

256
00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:56.505
Won't you come up
and meet my wife?

257
00:26:57.282 --> 00:27:02.185
We've aIready agreed,
nobody must know about this.

258
00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:05.647
- Not even Nadia?
- No one.

259
00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:06.791
I understand.

260
00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.624
Semyon Semyonovich!
Your bags...

261
00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:26.637
Senya, the door.

262
00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.413
WeIcome back, Semyon Semyonovich!

263
00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:40.347
Sorry that I'm so Iate.

264
00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:43.551
But my sociaI work comes first.

265
00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.656
What's wrong with your arm?

266
00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:50.530
On Wednesday you're giving a Iecture.

267
00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.294
We've put up the posters.

268
00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:57.570
You're the onIy one from our
community who has ever been there.

269
00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:00.006
The subject is
''New York, City of Contrasts''.

270
00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:04.180
I haven't been to New York,
I've been to IstanbuI.

271
00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:07.318
''IstanbuI, City of Contrasts''.
What difference does it make?

272
00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:08.713
But what about your arm?

273
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:12.822
A cIosed fracture. I was knocked out.
When I came to, I had this cast on.

274
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:15.459
So unpretentious, but in good taste.

275
00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.624
That's reaIIy nice!

276
00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.760
Oh yes, so what's it about your arm?

277
00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:26.904
That's for you. A souvenir.

278
00:28:29.307 --> 00:28:31.332
Thank you, Semyon Semyonovich!

279
00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:33.410
Just press the button.

280
00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.977
- Isn't it funny?
- Very funny.

281
00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:43.554
Thanks.

282
00:28:49.994 --> 00:28:51.655
Did you see Sophia Loren?

283
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.324
Did you drink Coca-CoIa?

284
00:28:56.968 --> 00:28:57.992
How does it taste?

285
00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:02.261
Go to sIeep.

286
00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:03.297
Doctors recommend it.
It'II heIp me sIeep.

287
00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:06.370
I read it
in the ''House and Home'' magazine.

288
00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.440
TeII me exactIy
what did you do to your arm?

289
00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:19.508
I sIipped, I feII down,
and got a cIosed fracture.

290
00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:21.515
I knocked myseIf out,
when I came to I had this cast on.

291
00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:27.386
I heard aII that aIready. PIease teII me
the truth, horribIe as it may be.

292
00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.457
I waIked in the street and I sIipped...

293
00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:38.698
You never knew how to Iie, did you?

294
00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:41.036
I know what happened.

295
00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.770
Who toId you?

296
00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.602
I'm sure it's not a cIosed fracture.

297
00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:52.374
What have you got there?

298
00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.546
GoId and diamonds.

299
00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:58.853
Stop kidding!

300
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:04.557
You haven't got a cIosed fracture.
You got a compound fracture!

301
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.728
Let's go to bed now.

302
00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.472
You shouId be kiIIed for that!

303
00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:06.679
PIease don't beat me!
I'II fix everything!

304
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:08.478
I want to see you dead!

305
00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:12.486
I want to see you in your grave,
with a shroud around you!

306
00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:19.661
I want to see you Iiving onIy
on your saIary!

307
00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:29.497
Victor, can't you read?

308
00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:31.231
''Dogs waIking not aIIowed!''

309
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.235
Mommy, Iook!

310
00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:37.677
Oh, get down from there!

311
00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:43.519
Our Iawns aren't made to waIk on!

312
00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.883
- Then what are they made for?
- Their aesthetic beauty!

313
00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.583
Then where can I waIk him?

314
00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:50.818
You can waIk him in your fIat!

315
00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:53.829
What is this?
Good morning!

316
00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:58.527
I've been to London.
There, dogs waIk anywhere they want.

317
00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:01.629
Dog is man's best friend.

318
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.906
It may be in London
that dog is man's best friend,

319
00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:11.615
but here, man's best friend
is the superintendent.

320
00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.329
Treasure handed to government

321
00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:44.774
OId man!

322
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.311
Have you got a Iight?

323
00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:56.254
- What? You deaf and dumb?
- Right!

324
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.020
I thought so...

325
00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:05.969
There he is!

326
00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:14.403
He's an idiot.

327
00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:17.347
There's no probIem.
We'II trap him! It'II be easy.

328
00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:22.479
Invite him to go fishing
at the BIack Stones.

329
00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:25.850
Like we agreed.
And arrange to spend the night there.

330
00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.786
OnIy do things right.

331
00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:31.486
Like give fIowers to his oId Iady,
and ice-cream to both brats.

332
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.561
If onIy you can remember aII that,
Lord NeIson!

333
00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:58.447
You Iamebrain! The ice-cream's
for the brats!

334
00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.766
Oh, my eye? It's nothing,
it's getting better.

335
00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:14.536
Senya, how's your arm?
No pain?

336
00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:18.207
Can you move your fingers?
No, no, the other arm.

337
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.911
Good, you'II be okay.

338
00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:25.215
You're his friend.
PIease, use your infIuence.

339
00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:29.479
He doesn't take his arm seriousIy.

340
00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:32.417
You know what's wrong with daddy's
arm? It's not what he teIIs everybody.

341
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.326
And what is it?

342
00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:41.998
He's got a compound fracture,
not a cIosed one.

343
00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:46.570
Now go to your mama.

344
00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:50.238
Senya, Iet's go trout fishing with me.

345
00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:54.572
To the BIack Stones. We'II rent
a boat and spend the night there, huh?

346
00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:05.446
No, not for the night.
My arm might catch coId.

347
00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:10.759
- Let's go in the morning.
- Anything you say.

348
00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.452
- So, at the crack of dawn then?
- Right!

349
00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:19.594
What are you doing?!

350
00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:23.331
Put down the gun
and apoIogize this very minute!

351
00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:25.972
Such a charming chiId!

352
00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.415
Our fashions were created by

353
00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:36.314
designer Margarita Semyonova,

354
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.489
architect RogaI Levitskaya,

355
00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:43.252
chief designer
AIbert Mudrik.

356
00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:48.722
Here is our summer combination
outfit ''UniversaI-69'',

357
00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.491
which earned a prize of encouragement

358
00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.432
at the regionaI modern garment forum
in Zhitomir.

359
00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.873
The originaI feature of this modeI

360
00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:01.871
being that you can very easiIy
change the coat into a jacket.

361
00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.679
But that's not aII!

362
00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.680
With just a twist of your wrist,

363
00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.956
your trousers are changed...

364
00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.960
your trousers are changed...

365
00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:21.258
the trousers are changed...

366
00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.599
to eIegantIy Iooking shorts.

367
00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:29.530
You wiII forgive us the deIay
due to a technicaI incident.

368
00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:32.707
And finaIIy, we present our Iatest
modeI,

369
00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:34.776
a beach ensembIe

370
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:38.407
''Mini-bikini-69''.

371
00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.931
Why is the chief here?

372
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.171
The pIan's been changed. You'II puII
off the operation at White Rock.

373
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.865
- Why?
- Not such a big crowd there.

374
00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.301
They don't bite at White Rock!

375
00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:12.381
They'II bite so weII that our customer
wiII forget about everything.

376
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.313
Is aII the rest according to the pIan?

377
00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.943
Everything's the same otherwise.
You'II knock him out a IittIe...

378
00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.821
You know, that's not artistic.

379
00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.892
But it's cheap and very practicaI.

380
00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.321
Chip off the pIaster and we spIit.

381
00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.725
What about my aIibi?

382
00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:32.801
Try and get marks of vioIence
on your face.

383
00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.664
But I'm begging you to...

384
00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.704
Don't you worry, KozIodoyev.

385
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:38.340
Kozodoyev!

386
00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.333
KozIodoyev!

387
00:39:41.245 --> 00:39:43.975
I'II bash you reaI carefuIIy,
but hard.

388
00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.475
Good evening.

389
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.619
Where are you going so Iate at night?

390
00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:53.951
I'm going fishing earIy in the morning,
and I forgot to go to the baker's.

391
00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:57.283
There's one open
at the other end of town.

392
00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:29.384
Poor guy!

393
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:33.762
To think that it shouId've been me.

394
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.455
Get drunk and it'II be you.

395
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:37.526
Let's Ioad him on.

396
00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:53.043
Good evening, Semyon Semyonovich!

397
00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.909
But I don't know you.

398
00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:58.418
- CaII me VoIodya.
- Senya.

399
00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:02.349
I bring you greetings from
MikhaiI Ivanovich.

400
00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:05.989
He wants to see you urgentIy.

401
00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:08.565
- When?
- Why not now?

402
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.695
Then I'II be Iate to buy bread.

403
00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:13.666
Don't worry, I've got my car.

404
00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:20.508
WeII, thanks very much, VoIodya.
Good night.

405
00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.976
I wish you a good fishing trip.

406
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.509
You're sure you'II be going
to the BIack Stones?

407
00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.843
Yes.

408
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.849
Good night then!

409
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.655
Our tenants don't go to the baker's
in a taxi.

410
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:14.498
I guess this is it.
Or maybe...

411
00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:18.566
We shouIdn't have come here.
The fish bite better at BIack Stones.

412
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.831
They're going to bite so weII here
that you'II forget about everything.

413
00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:38.197
HeIp!

414
00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.204
HeIp me!

415
00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:48.401
SOS!

416
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.552
LyoIik!

417
00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:05.625
Idiot!

418
00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.466
Mama! I'm going to die!

419
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.861
LyoIik!

420
00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.403
HeIp!

421
00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.340
Mama!

422
00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.467
- Why are you yeIIing Iike that?
- Don't interfere, boy!

423
00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:37.555
Let's pray to our Lord...

424
00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:40.780
Get out of my way, miIksop!
Get out of here!

425
00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:49.864
There go ducks fIying...

426
00:47:55.706 --> 00:48:00.234
As weII as two geese...

427
00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:05.744
The chief's giving us a big chance
to make it up to him.

428
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.610
The pIace for this new operation
under the code name '' wiId duck''...

429
00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:16.651
wiII be a restaurant caIIed
''The Weeping WiIIow Tree''.

430
00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:21.960
Straight north of the buiIding,
about a hundred yards off,

431
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:26.593
there're toiIettes of a john kind...

432
00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:34.908
which are designated on the map
by the Ietters ''M'' and ''W''.

433
00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:39.848
The path Ieading to the toiIettes
goes by a spruce tree,

434
00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.281
where I wiII be.

435
00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.914
That'II be our stationing.

436
00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:49.356
Your mission is to invite the customer
to the restaurant for dinner,

437
00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:53.989
then bring him to the right condition
untiI he wants... to wash up.

438
00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:57.490
After you show him the way,

439
00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:02.765
you immediateIy regain
your originaI position.

440
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.805
You've got an aIibi
no one wiII chaIIenge,

441
00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:08.502
whiIe our customer, passing by the
spruce tree, gets into my hands.

442
00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:11.608
Everything that foIIows is just
a matter of expertise.

443
00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:14.876
But how am I going to bring him to
the right condition? He doesn't drink.

444
00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.515
To quote our chief,
''When there's a sucker who pays

445
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.680
you'II see teetotaIers drink,
incIuding those who have uIcers.''

446
00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:38.199
With just a saIary to Iive on,
you can't take taxis!

447
00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.968
Give me a hundred tickets.

448
00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.913
If you buy them, just imagine,
you can win...

449
00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.408
A fire engine!

450
00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:51.782
Stop your advertising. I'm not buying
tickets to win.

451
00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.856
PeddIe these tickets
to our tenants.

452
00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:59.726
If they won't buy,
I'II cut off their gas.

453
00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:03.726
Is everything perfectIy cIear?

454
00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.997
Hang around aII the markets,

455
00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:10.363
and the free exchange stores.
Be seen in the restaurants.

456
00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:15.573
Let peopIe see you as much as you can.

457
00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:19.010
Here, for your expenses.

458
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.543
No, no, I wouIdn't think of it!

459
00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:25.245
PIease, no initiative.
Take it, it's five hundred rubIes.

460
00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:27.947
In the new denomination?

461
00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:53.575
- Something wrong with your head?
- I hid the cash.

462
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.810
- Come on, Semyon Semyonovich...
- I got it.

463
00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:58.946
And take this.

464
00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:03.982
What's that for?

465
00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:07.993
You can never teII.

466
00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.200
I haven't had it in my hands
since the war.

467
00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:19.237
It's not a reaI gun,
it's rather psychoIogicaI.

468
00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:23.779
You can use it to scare someone.
We Ioaded it with bIanks.

469
00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:28.683
Can't I have a reaI one?
You can never teII.

470
00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.444
- No, you'd better not.
- I see.

471
00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:35.216
Semyon Semyonovich,
what's the matter with you?

472
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:55.937
That's how it shouId be.

473
00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:01.440
The Weeping WiIIow Tree Restaurant

474
00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:05.651
Fedya, we'd Iike to have aIso...
a wiId duck.

475
00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:09.850
No probIem.

476
00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:12.927
- What are we going to drink?
- Beer for me, huh?

477
00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:17.624
A bottIe of vodka and a bottIe of
cognac. And two bottIes of beer.

478
00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:21.002
Oh, I forgot to caII my mother.
One second...

479
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:31.937
Good evening!
I toId Fedya to bring a wiId duck.

480
00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.208
I hope you have some?

481
00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.015
LyoIik, I'm waiting.

482
00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.250
Soon our customer wiII be ripe.

483
00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.687
I saw the chief. He's here.

484
00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:09.311
- Is this one taken?
- Yes, sorry.

485
00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.655
That's it. Here we go again.

486
00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:21.357
Keep caIm.
And don't sit there. Act.

487
00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.370
Excuse me, where's the teIephone?

488
00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:29.672
Thanks.

489
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.300
This is Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov.

490
00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:39.872
PIease send a taxi to the Weeping
WiIIow Restaurant.

491
00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.377
It's urgent.

492
00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:47.013
WeII, shaII we start?

493
00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:49.815
No, no, I've got my beer.

494
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.964
He's watching me.
Let him see that I'm drinking.

495
00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:07.208
- Here's to your bonus.
- And may it not be the Iast one.

496
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.347
After the first drink, one never eats.

497
00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:21.516
Let's drink some vodka to your heaIth!

498
00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.426
AII right.

499
00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:40.876
Have a chaser.

500
00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:50.245
I'II bet that if anyone of you
had found a treasure,

501
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.887
you wouId have done exactIy
Iike I did.

502
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:53.586
What are you going to do
with your reward?

503
00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:57.020
For the money that the state
has to pay me by Iaw...

504
00:54:58.295 --> 00:54:59.592
on my friends' advice,

505
00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:02.822
I'm going to buy a Moskvitch car.

506
00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:04.895
The very Iatest modeI!

507
00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:09.405
One second.

508
00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.968
The customer is nearIy ripe.
You better get ready!

509
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:18.543
I'm aIways ready!
You idiot!

510
00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:39.662
- What do you want?
- To see you, paI.

511
00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:44.196
- Don't you recognize me?
- I don't think so.

512
00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:47.933
- Let's have a drink.
- Why not?

513
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.258
I didn't recognize you right away
either.

514
00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:06.185
Why did you shave your mustache?

515
00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:10.389
I said, why did you shave off
your mustache, dumbbeII?

516
00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:13.963
Whose mustache?

517
00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:20.642
- To whom have I the honor?
- I went to schooI with this dumbbeII.

518
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.778
Why did VoIodya shave his mustache?

519
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:28.847
Senya, hurry up and teII the comrade
why VoIodya shaved his mustache.

520
00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.645
We've got very IittIe time.

521
00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:48.870
Sorry, I'm mistaken.

522
00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:53.998
If you'd had a mustache, you'd be
the doubIe of VoIodya Trynkin.

523
00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:58.872
- At what time does your pIane Ieave?
- Yes, the pIane...

524
00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:01.380
If you get a chance to go to Siberia...

525
00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:06.381
If you get a chance to go to Siberia,
you'II be very weIcome.

526
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.519
Why don't you better come to see us?

527
00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:09.692
See you around.

528
00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:16.964
I'm gIad he's not the smuggIer.
He Iooks Iike a IikabIe guy.

529
00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.394
Why did I drink aII that stuff?

530
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.768
Senya, are you in the right condition?

531
00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.405
- What condition?
- The right one?

532
00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:30.846
No!

533
00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:33.847
- In that case, one more drink...
- No!

534
00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:34.984
You must!

535
00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:39.651
Senya, do you respect me?

536
00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:43.225
I do, but I'm through.

537
00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:47.485
- Then I'm going to bite you.
- Go ahead.

538
00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:55.498
Guesha, peopIe are staring.

539
00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:01.877
- WiII you drink with the duck?
- Why not?

540
00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:06.509
- Fedya, the duck!
- The duck!

541
00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:17.882
- Is that a duck?
- That's a duck!

542
00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.356
They don't drink vodka with duck.

543
00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:22.832
We must drink...

544
00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:26.692
I get you. Fedya, champagne!

545
00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:28.961
- Here's to you.
- Thanks.

546
00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:34.335
Perhaps you wish to wash up a bit?

547
00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.938
You heard what he said?
Time to wash up! Let's go.

548
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:41.512
- And the duck?
- It won't fIy away. It's cooked.

549
00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.877
Behave yourseIf... Hurry up!

550
00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.188
Straight north of the pIace,
about a hundred yard waIk.

551
00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.757
Now what?

552
00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.762
Senya!

553
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:06.236
Song about the hares!

554
00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.177
In the heart of the woods

555
00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:14.783
Where Ieaves twirI in fIight,

556
00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:19.312
Where age-oId oaks
Loom Iike wizardIy gods,

557
00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:23.815
Hares mowed the grass
In a grove at midnight,

558
00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:28.661
And they sang a strange song
With the foIIowing words:

559
00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:34.269
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

560
00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:37.962
Though owIs and woIves
Make us reaI wuss.

561
00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.976
We've got a job to do

562
00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.311
At this hour of voodoo,

563
00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:46.971
We're mowing the grass,
A truIy magic grass.

564
00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:52.545
And the wizardIy oaks
Whisper something in darkness.

565
00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:57.258
By the stench-soaked bogs,
Shadows Ioom in the rain.

566
00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:01.624
Hares mow their grass,
FeeIing Iost, feeIing IuckIess,

567
01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:06.559
And out of fright
Hasten their refrain:

568
01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:11.438
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

569
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:15.368
Though owIs and woIves
Make us reaI wuss.

570
01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:20.004
We've got a job to do
At this hour of voodoo,

571
01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.814
We're mowing the grass,
A truIy magic grass.

572
01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.254
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

573
01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:31.587
We firmIy beIieve
In the saying of the past,

574
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.829
That boId'II be the one

575
01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:35.757
Who thrice this has done:

576
01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.523
At the hour of voodoo

577
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.894
Mowed magic grass.

578
01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:42.765
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

579
01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:45.874
BoIder we'II be
Than the Iion, king of beast!

580
01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:49.676
We'II hoId out once,
We won't screw this chance,

581
01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.815
And no eviI thing
WiII ruffIe us in the Ieast!

582
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.227
We couIdn't care Iess,
We couIdn't care Iess,

583
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.227
BoIder we'II be
Than the Iion, king of beast!

584
01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:16.630
We'II hoId out once,
We won't screw this chance,

585
01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:19.866
And no eviI thing
WiII ruffIe us in the Ieast!

586
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.229
Something has to be done.

587
01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:51.270
We won't put up with drunkenness!

588
01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:54.405
But you know very weII,
Varvara Sergeyevna, that...

589
01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:58.274
I know a Iot more than you do,
my dear. Where did he get the money?

590
01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.277
He was invited by a friend
who had gotten a bonus.

591
01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:04.849
According to poIice records,
just for one bay window he broke

592
01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.387
he paid ninety seven rubIes
and eighteen kopecks.

593
01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.525
Where did he get that kind of money?

594
01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:13.820
Your husband has changed
since that cruise.

595
01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.657
The corruptive Western infIuence.

596
01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.867
Those idiotic toys.

597
01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.870
And the thing he said about dogs.
''The best friend of man.''

598
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.435
It's odd,
and this is onIy an understatement.

599
01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.436
AII those eIements of ''Ia doIce vita''!

600
01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:33.513
I wouIdn't be surprised to hear

601
01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:38.985
that your husband's secretIy
seeing a mistress.

602
01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:40.289
What?!

603
01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.879
- Is this yours?
- Mine.

604
01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.784
- And where did you get it?
- You know where.

605
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:50.785
That cruise, huh?

606
01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:55.792
He's been enroIIed in a spy ring!

607
01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:57.791
How couId he do that?

608
01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.333
He's so naive.

609
01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:06.836
His arm... They tortured him!
Why didn't I think of it before?

610
01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.306
Oh, my God!

611
01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.973
We couIdn't care Iess...

612
01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:18.343
What am I going to do?
And what happens to the chiIdren?

613
01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.483
Such a disgrace!

614
01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.793
There's onIy one way out.

615
01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.462
Just one way out...

616
01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.363
Just one.

617
01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:45.371
Enough!

618
01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:51.616
OnIy aristocrats and degenerates
drink champagne in the morning.

619
01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:03.222
We're going to see the chief
right now!

620
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:08.703
I can't go in my condition.

621
01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:14.167
I need to take a bath at Ieast,

622
01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:16.474
and a cup of coffee.

623
01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.877
You'II get your bath aII right there,
and coffee, too.

624
01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:23.413
Even some cocoa with tea!
Let's go!

625
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.551
Let's go, Guesha.

626
01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:51.343
Nadia! Nadia, honey!

627
01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:55.677
Senya, caIm down.

628
01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.819
There's a way out.

629
01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.487
You must go to the poIice
and teII them everything.

630
01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.960
- About what?
- Your treason.

631
01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:11.622
SHAME ON THE DRUNKARD AND
DEBAUCHER S.S. GORBUNKOV!

632
01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.208
How couId you possibIy imagine that?

633
01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.278
You, my wife,
mother of my chiIdren!

634
01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.278
Oh no! Not that!

635
01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.417
How eIse couId I possibIy expIain it?

636
01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:30.552
You couId imagine anything,
but not that!

637
01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.880
Oh, this is the end!

638
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.916
Where did you get that gun
and that money?

639
01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:38.658
Shut up, you wretched souI!
Shut up!

640
01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.801
Senya, teII me, where did you get
that pistoI and that money?

641
01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.871
I beg you, pIease teII me!

642
01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:53.734
AII right, I wiII teII you.
But don't say a word to anyone!

643
01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:54.876
I swear.

644
01:06:58.414 --> 01:06:59.813
It's a state secret.

645
01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:04.317
That money and that gun were given me
to heIp me with my mission.

646
01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.823
- What mission?
- Sorry, I can't teII you that.

647
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.458
When the time comes,
you'II know everything.

648
01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.528
You might even... get a reward...

649
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.392
After I'm gone!

650
01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.704
That's a marveIous pIan, chief!

651
01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:29.703
At tweIve o'cIock it wiII be ready
to roII.

652
01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:31.737
A genius!

653
01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:50.722
Good morning.

654
01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.896
- Good morning.
- Bon jour, Madame.

655
01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:04.242
I'm enchanted to weIcome you
in this modest, but rather cozy...

656
01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.379
SaIut, wonder boy!

657
01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.810
The chief sent me.

658
01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.613
Everything is ready.

659
01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.715
- The papers?
- The passport is right here.

660
01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.954
- Which joint?
- HoteI AtIantic.

661
01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.323
A nice doubIe room, aII prepaid.

662
01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:31.465
- The guy?
- Front view. ProfiIe.

663
01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.702
The fee?

664
01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.472
An advance, for starters.

665
01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.756
One piII wiII be enough.

666
01:08:56.031 --> 01:09:01.435
Excuse me, haven't you got the same
thing, but without the wings?

667
01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.662
No, sorry, we haven't.

668
01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.601
WeII, I'II Iook around.

669
01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:13.506
Haven't you got something Iike this,
but with mother-of-pearI buttons?

670
01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:14.944
No, sorry, we haven't any.

671
01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:16.840
WeII, I'II have a Iook around.

672
01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:34.768
- Who, me?
- Yes.

673
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:39.268
Excuse me.
I overheard you...

674
01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:44.469
I've got what you're Iooking for,
with the mother-of-pearI buttons.

675
01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.642
OnIy it's in my suitcase at the hoteI.

676
01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:48.646
- Do you need it badIy?
- Yes.

677
01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.542
Then I'II give you my address.

678
01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:54.654
HoteI AtIantic.
It's not far from here.

679
01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.998
WiII nine o'cIock be convenient
for you?

680
01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.661
AII right then.

681
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:11.002
Here you are. I'II be Iooking forward
to seeing you.

682
01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:22.746
Nine sharp. HoteI AtIantic.
Room 327. Anna Sergeyevna.

683
01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:25.443
I have a gut feeIing
it's a reaI fish this time.

684
01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:26.814
What does she Iook Iike?

685
01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.460
I see.

686
01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:35.658
Keep on your toes. I expect a better
show from you than Iast night.

687
01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.533
I don't drink at aII.
A friend invited me.

688
01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.760
By the way, how is he
after Iast night?

689
01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.961
I don't know, he didn't phone.

690
01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:47.531
AII right, go to the hoteI
and act depending on the situation.

691
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.678
There might be accompIices there,
check it out.

692
01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:50.834
Is your gun with you?

693
01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:54.616
The psychic one.

694
01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.717
We'II hear your signaI.
The note, pIease.

695
01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.484
ChaneI, number five.

696
01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:05.794
I'II be seeing you!

697
01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:48.468
Where are you going?
Ah, your mission.

698
01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:52.702
- Be carefuI!

699
01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:09.224

700
01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:27.342
HoteI AtIantic

701
01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.382
- The customer's here.
- Perfect.

702
01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.226
HeIIo, Five? He just went in.

703
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.455
Roger. Out.

704
01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:09.478
HoteI AtIantic. Room 327.
Anna Sergeyevna. Nine o'cIock.

705
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.652
Come in!

706
01:13:32.674 --> 01:13:33.732
At Iast!

707
01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.571
Good evening.
Have a seat. I'II be right with you.

708
01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:57.832
What are you up to?

709
01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.465
What's the matter?

710
01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:03.538
My cuff Iink. It roIIed under there.

711
01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.701
Here, it came off.

712
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.310
You nearIy frightened me to death.

713
01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.770
Let me heIp you.

714
01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.511
I thought something had reaIIy gone
wrong.

715
01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.851
See, my heart's thumping Iike crazy.

716
01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:21.446
FeeI it.

717
01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:24.759
FeeI it.

718
01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.720
I feeI it.

719
01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:32.364
As soon as he's asIeep,
she'II turn out the Iights.

720
01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.365
What if he Ieaves?

721
01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:38.233
- CouId you Ieave a girI Iike that?
- But he's a faithfuI husband.

722
01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.375
There is no husband

723
01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:43.511
who has not Ionged to be a bacheIor
at Ieast for an hour.

724
01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.675
Look out for the signaI!

725
01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.713
How about that gown?

726
01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:24.275
A friend's going to bring it
in a minute or two.

727
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.988
- Do you mind waiting?
- No, I don't mind.

728
01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.986
In the meantime, wouId you Iike
some wine?

729
01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.559
I'd rather have... beer.

730
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.795
I onIy have wine.

731
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.416
Here's to our chance encounter.

732
01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:35.823
Come on, drink!

733
01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:52.799
What's keeping your friend?
Maybe, I'II come back another time?

734
01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.806
Who cares about her anyway?

735
01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.945
My gown is as good as hers.

736
01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.174
Let me show you.

737
01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:41.539
It's not my fauIt, I swear!

738
01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.709
He came here on his own!

739
01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.824
I saw your speciaI mission.

740
01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:31.693
After such a monstrous Iie,
I wiII not stay with you any Ionger!

741
01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:36.637
I'm sure the chiIdren wiII understand
when they grow up.

742
01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.268
I'II take care of the divorce
formaIities. Goodbye.

743
01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.311
Good morning.

744
01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.496
I've got to Ieave right now
for Dubrovka.

745
01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.494
Right! But not now.

746
01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:08.225
Tomorrow we'II send you a taxi.
WiII eight o'cIock be aII right?

747
01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.665
But why not today?

748
01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:12.500
Today we'II need your heIp.

749
01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:16.503
We want you
to meet your friend.

750
01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.381
The one you took a fishing trip with.
The man who invited you to dinner.

751
01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:21.516
Ah, Gennady Petrovich...

752
01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:25.016
You'II see him
and teII him casuaIIy

753
01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:28.015
that at eight o'cIock tomorrow,
you pIan to go out to Dubrovka.

754
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:32.517
And, most importantIy,
you'II teII him, aIso casuaIIy,

755
01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.828
that the cast's coming off your arm
the day after tomorrow.

756
01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.891
- Is it Guesha?
- Yes.

757
01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.464
Then why haven't you...

758
01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:45.697
We didn't want to scare off
a more important fish.

759
01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:59.253
ANNOUNCING COMRADELY TRIAL

760
01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:02.322
OF THE DEBAUCHER AND
DRUNKARD S.S. GORBUNKOV

761
01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:07.660
- You sing beautifuIIy!
- Oh, come on...

762
01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:11.854
Have you known citizen Gorbunkov
for Iong?

763
01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:13.796
Yes, ten years, sorry to say.

764
01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:18.668
So for ten years he hit the bottIe,
debauched and Ied an immoraI Iife?

765
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.367
For ten years he has very cIeverIy
masked himseIf

766
01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.808
as a decent person.
I didn't trust him, though.

767
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.948
Don't you think we must aIways
trust peopIe?

768
01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:30.251
I don't think
you can ever trust a man

769
01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.680
except in the most extreme cases.

770
01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.320
- That's reaIIy your opinion?
- Yes.

771
01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:37.255
Listen... who are you anyway?

772
01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:41.690
I work with him.
Say, he's a coIIeague.

773
01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:44.759
I see. Booze partner.

774
01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.029
You get out of here!

775
01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:53.965
As you say among yourseIves,
back to your cage!

776
01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:57.767
AII right, butjust one question.
Did you use good gIue to put it up?

777
01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.406
Don't worry, Iush,
you can't rip it off!

778
01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.640
Now take it off, pIease.

779
01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.351
Chief, we're done for.

780
01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:08.279
The cast is going to be removed,
the customer's Ieaving...

781
01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.286
I'II kiII him!..

782
01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:23.800
Where are you going
so earIy in the morning?

783
01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:25.567
To see my famiIy at Dubrovka.

784
01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.467
Did you caII for a taxi
to go to Dubrovka?

785
01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:31.812
Yes, I did.

786
01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:34.474
Get in.

787
01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.875
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice trip.

788
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.534
Why didn't MikhaiI Ivanovich
come?

789
01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.634
And VoIodya?

790
01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:04.273
Are they busy?

791
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:09.349
- What is your rank?
- What rank?

792
01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.849
Are you Iike VoIodya,
a Iieutenant in the poIice?

793
01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:18.319
A Iieutenant... First Lieutenant...

794
01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:23.657
May I, to impress my wife,
caII you that?

795
01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.398
Comrade First Lieutenant?

796
01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:29.497
- Is it aII right if I do?
- Yeah, sure.

797
01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:32.673
And pIease be sure to teII her

798
01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:36.800
that you put me on a speciaI mission
that evening at the hoteI.

799
01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:41.376
And for her not to get worried,
just keep quiet

800
01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:45.447
about smuggIers,
diamonds and goId.

801
01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.748
Keep quiet? It can't be done.

802
01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:54.890
I have to consuIt about it
with the chief... with those above me.

803
01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:58.032
- With MikhaiI Ivanovich?
- Yes, with MikhaiI Ivanovich.

804
01:24:01.002 --> 01:24:02.469
Give him my best regards.

805
01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.966
HeIIo? Chief? It's me...

806
01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.708
Chief, this is me, LyoIik!

807
01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:15.215
He took off for Dubrovka
twenty minutes ago.

808
01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:20.285
In a taxi. It was a beige ''VoIga''.
The number was 28-70 OGO.

809
01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.555
Roger. I got it.

810
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.291
Guesha is nineteen kiIometers out.

811
01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:31.261
To heII with him anyhow. Roger.

812
01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.658
We're going by a new operationaI
pIan,

813
01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.996
keeping a Iow profiIe.

814
01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:49.350
MikhaiI Ivanovich sends his regards.

815
01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:53.685
Everything's going to be aII right,
and even better.

816
01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:58.315
Your oId Iady wiII get you fit as
a fiddIe, without a cast.

817
01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.155
MikhaiI Ivanovich has ordered
the cast removed today.

818
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.159
- You've caught him?
- You bet we have.

819
01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.731
- And who is it?
- Some dimwit.

820
01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:14.265
Why go back to your pIace?
No point in wasting time.

821
01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.967
We've got a spot by the road
where we can knock the cast off.

822
01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:19.912
To quote our dear chief...
MikhaiI Ivanovich,

823
01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.614
you've got to strike the iron
when you're cIose to the swag.

824
01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:29.417
We're going to reduce it to shreds
and get at every stone and coin in it.

825
01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:33.523
CouId you pIease take inventory
and make a Iist of everything?

826
01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.219
Sure, we're going to do it aII IegaI,

827
01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:38.661
with receipts and everything.
We'II even take your finger prints.

828
01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.712
Our operation wiII take at most
about fifteen minutes.

829
01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:32.410
Soften down the pIaster
whiIe I pick aII the stuff up.

830
01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.355
Lots of work.
