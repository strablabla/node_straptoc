1
00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:55.880
Birju!

2
00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:58.372
Uncle!

3
00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:05.413
You have become such a wealthy
man, yet you haven't changed.

4
00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:09.807
Whatever I am, is due to
the blessings of all of you.

5
00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:15.751
Where is the birthday boy? He
is here... Look! There he is!

6
00:03:19.276 --> 00:03:19.828
Brother.

7
00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.055
May you live long, my brother!

8
00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.554
If our parents were alive
today, they'd have been so happy.

9
00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:34.782
I have not seen my parents.

10
00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:40.692
But whenever you touched
my head to bless me,...

11
00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.975
... I felt as if they had blessed me.

12
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.065
Did you see that, uncle?

13
00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:54.799
Until yesterday, he used to
play on my lap, and today...

14
00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:58.740
Today, he talks like a big man.

15
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:05.004
- Let's go and cut the cake.
- But brother, Madhu...

16
00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.487
Yes! You will not cut
the cake without her.

17
00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:16.679
Best wishes for your brother's birthday.

18
00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.749
Wow! A 'Raja'(king) and a 'Rani'(Queen)!

19
00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:21.114
This is you and me.

20
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.955
I am Raja, but you are Madhu.

21
00:04:24.775 --> 00:04:27.341
Yes, you are right. Come with me.

22
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:32.297
Brother, why isn't my name
Rani, when his name is Raja?

23
00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:35.326
Yes, that should have been the case.

24
00:04:37.192 --> 00:04:40.034
Okay, we'll call you Rani from today.

25
00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:46.368
What are you thinking about, Brijnath?

26
00:04:48.097 --> 00:04:51.394
- I was thinking, that...
- I understand.

27
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:55.228
Why don't we change our
friendship into an alliance?

28
00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:01.006
You have voiced my thoughts exactly.

29
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:06.808
I present this ring as a token
of this auspicious occasion.

30
00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:09.620
We are related from today.

31
00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:15.949
- Sir, there's a call for you.
- Excuse me.

32
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.071
- There is a fire in the building.
- What!

33
00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:54.078
Do not cry, Raja.
Everything will be fine.

34
00:05:58.836 --> 00:06:00.623
Look at this...

35
00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.838
Everything is over.

36
00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.842
Even if I sell myself,...

37
00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:13.715
... I won't be able to
compensate for this devastation.

38
00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.595
I knew, that at such times,...

39
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:24.785
... only one man would
come to wipe my tears.

40
00:06:25.288 --> 00:06:28.731
If fate could be changed
by wiping one's tears,...

41
00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:30.945
... then I would certainly do that.

42
00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:33.093
But that does not happen.

43
00:06:33.695 --> 00:06:38.864
I have come to return the ring.
This alliance cannot be fixed now.

44
00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.889
- What are you doing?
- Keep your mouth shut!

45
00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.644
I know what I'm doing. Today he
is not our eQual. He is finished!

46
00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:55.853
Mr. Rana, was our friendship
based only on status?

47
00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:59.471
Yes! When status is lost,
friendship won't exist either!

48
00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:03.524
And when friendship does not exist,
then neither can this alliance!

49
00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:05.238
Here's the ring.

50
00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:12.210
- Come on.
- I want to go with Raja.

51
00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:14.638
You have nothing to do
with Raja anymore. Come on.

52
00:07:19.953 --> 00:07:21.991
Where are you going? Come on!

53
00:07:26.741 --> 00:07:29.128
Raja, stop!

54
00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:35.066
I want to go to Raja!

55
00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:12.849
Is brother Birju okay, auntie?

56
00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:17.462
Why are you Quiet? Is he okay?

57
00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:22.202
For God's sake, tell
me! How is my brother?!

58
00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.719
No!... No!

59
00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:30.509
Brother Birju!

60
00:08:38.994 --> 00:08:47.606
It doesn't come together... it does not.

61
00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:31.746
Brother...!

62
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.200
What happened?

63
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.638
No!

64
00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:00.956
What's wrong with you?

65
00:11:02.372 --> 00:11:03.918
What happened to Birju?

66
00:11:05.924 --> 00:11:06.656
Quickly put him on the bed.

67
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.140
Sister, Quickly telephone
the mental hospital.

68
00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:25.440
Auntie, ask the doctor not to
send my brother to the asylum!

69
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.089
He will not be able to live without me.

70
00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:36.376
Raja, he'll have to be admitted
there. It's for his own good.

71
00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:42.566
If he sees tears in your eyes,
it'll be difficult to take him.

72
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.645
Wipe your tears, dear.

73
00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:50.277
I can understand your pain, son.

74
00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:53.548
But you will have to control yourself.

75
00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:57.275
I want to go with Raja.

76
00:11:58.372 --> 00:12:02.546
They are bringing him. Please be Quiet.

77
00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:13.173
Raja, where are they taking me?

78
00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.769
They are taking you
to a better hospital.

79
00:12:17.226 --> 00:12:20.849
There will be specialists.
You will be treated properly.

80
00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.151
Once you have recovered,
I'll take you home.

81
00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.658
I will return home soon, won't I?

82
00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:33.256
No! I will not go anywhere without you.

83
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.914
I'm coming with you.
You sit in the ambulance.

84
00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:39.316
I'll fetch your things and medicines.

85
00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.784
Okay. I'll wait for
you in the ambulance.

86
00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:48.453
Take me to a better hospital.

87
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.147
I have to get okay and return home soon.

88
00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:51.978
My brother is all alone.

89
00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:08.966
Why have you... ? Doctor,
my brother will be coming.

90
00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:11.179
He'll come, Birju.

91
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.640
I will not go without my brother!

92
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.445
Brother Birju!

93
00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:28.662
I cannot live without you.

94
00:17:55.623 --> 00:18:02.159
Raja, I hit a goal and we won!

95
00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:05.496
Yes, brother. We've won.

96
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:13.701
Birju, here's a kilo of carrots for you.

97
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.301
Doctor, how are you?

98
00:18:18.803 --> 00:18:21.333
- How are you?
- Very fine.

99
00:18:21.723 --> 00:18:25.201
- Come home and have tea.
- No. I've got to go to the hospital.

100
00:18:25.592 --> 00:18:28.890
- Please have a cup.
- Fine.

101
00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:33.430
Oh dear!

102
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:36.524
What nonsense is this?

103
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:39.690
Aren't you ashamed of
throwing this on the road?

104
00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:42.682
I say, show up!

105
00:18:43.532 --> 00:18:45.846
Nobody will come out like this.

106
00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:54.039
Whose silver spoon is this?

107
00:18:54.507 --> 00:18:57.109
Silver spoon?... It's mine.

108
00:18:57.498 --> 00:19:00.940
It is yours, eh? Here you are.

109
00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:05.970
Henceforth, throw the litter
in the municipality bin.

110
00:19:06.327 --> 00:19:10.441
Take the money for the egg
from him... Let's go, doctor.

111
00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:17.887
Raja, your brother is
unbelievable! What brains!

112
00:19:18.673 --> 00:19:21.551
That man will never throw
litter on the road now.

113
00:19:21.944 --> 00:19:27.149
Nor will he eat eggs. Please sit.
I'll prepare some carrot sweetmeat.

114
00:19:27.854 --> 00:19:29.425
Hey listen!...

115
00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:35.794
Is he the same man, whom
you had pleaded with,...

116
00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:37.979
... 15 years ago, to
come to the hospital?

117
00:19:38.513 --> 00:19:46.141
The changes that I see in him is
due to your love and dedication.

118
00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:49.026
You are indeed incredible, son!

119
00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:51.661
I have done the incredible, Raja.

120
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:54.902
I have brought such a
superb girl for you...

121
00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.822
... that you will get a
heart attack when you see her.

122
00:19:58.528 --> 00:20:00.663
Here's her photograph.

123
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:07.917
Isn't she gorgeous?

124
00:20:08.237 --> 00:20:10.240
Fool! You found this girl for me?

125
00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:15.121
She isn't a girl from
an ordinary family,...

126
00:20:15.553 --> 00:20:18.360
...but from a very respectable one.

127
00:20:18.755 --> 00:20:23.252
Her father owns 8 liQuor
dens and 15 distilleries.

128
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.756
He is no ordinary man!

129
00:20:28.253 --> 00:20:32.294
Get lost, fool! My Raja won't
marry some ordinary girl.

130
00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.855
He'll marry only a 'Rani'(Queen).

131
00:20:35.253 --> 00:20:39.402
You are right, auntie.
God has made one for me.

132
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.980
But I wonder where she is now.

133
00:21:38.851 --> 00:21:44.789
Rascal! You eat my hand
as if it were a toast!

134
00:21:46.449 --> 00:21:48.800
- You're looking stunning today.
- Thank you.

135
00:21:49.263 --> 00:21:50.630
Where were you last night?

136
00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:55.383
Last night, I got so badly trapped,...

137
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.490
Sorry sir, I spoilt your clothes.

138
00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:02.484
Fool! Can't you see
where you are walking?...

139
00:22:02.876 --> 00:22:06.810
Don't be angry. He is a poor
man. Everyone makes mistakes.

140
00:22:07.168 --> 00:22:08.355
Go and do your work.

141
00:22:09.842 --> 00:22:16.618
Amazing man! His clothes got soiled
and he didn't even protest. Who's he?

142
00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:20.422
He is a very noble man. He
does not know what anger is.

143
00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:25.203
He is Gandhi reincarnate. People
call him 'Shantipati'(Peaceful One).

144
00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:28.165
I can destroy his peace
of mind in two minutes!

145
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:32.703
Even if you kill yourself banging
your head, he will not get angry.

146
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:38.962
Want to bet? I will not abuse him.
Yet, I'll put him in such a plight...

147
00:22:39.354 --> 00:22:42.124
... that he will tear his
clothes and scream like a madman.

148
00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:44.489
The same manager will send
him to a mental hospital.

149
00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:49.902
If I do it, then will you
hit your head with your shoe?

150
00:22:55.535 --> 00:22:59.961
It is God's gift. I keep anger at bay.

151
00:23:00.425 --> 00:23:05.522
Sir, I want to talk to you
for 2 minutes. May I sit here?

152
00:23:05.983 --> 00:23:08.082
Please do.

153
00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:13.438
- What is the matter?
- Well, it is...

154
00:23:14.073 --> 00:23:17.227
First promise me that
you will not be angry.

155
00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:21.378
Why should I be angry?
Tell me, what the matter is.

156
00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:25.497
I would have told you. But
I'm afraid, you will get angry.

157
00:23:25.857 --> 00:23:29.790
No. You are unnecessarily
getting scared. I never get angry.

158
00:23:30.184 --> 00:23:32.810
- Tell me without hesitation.
- All right.

159
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:37.848
Well,... never mind. You will get angry.

160
00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:43.408
I have told you, I do
not get angry. So tell me.

161
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:46.004
Look! You are already
getting a bit angry.

162
00:23:46.611 --> 00:23:52.872
I do not get angry. Please
tell me, what the matter is.

163
00:23:53.576 --> 00:23:56.106
You're lying. You are getting angry.

164
00:23:56.882 --> 00:23:59.341
I swear by God,... I am not angry!

165
00:23:59.978 --> 00:24:03.601
Kindly tell me, what the matter is.

166
00:24:03.953 --> 00:24:05.560
Never mind. You are angry!

167
00:24:05.923 --> 00:24:11.224
Just a minute, madam...
Ramprasad, am I getting angry?

168
00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.703
Yes, sir. A little.

169
00:24:14.154 --> 00:24:16.228
- This is not anger!
- This is anger.

170
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.617
- You are sweating.
- What nonsense...!

171
00:24:21.084 --> 00:24:24.143
Your eyes have become bloodshot.

172
00:24:25.867 --> 00:24:28.854
Your nostrils are flaring.

173
00:24:29.315 --> 00:24:33.357
And you are breathing fire!

174
00:24:34.591 --> 00:24:37.926
- And you say, you are not angry?
- No! I do not get angry!

175
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.231
I do not!

176
00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:47.350
- Do I look angry?
- Yes.

177
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.376
I do not get angry!

178
00:24:55.767 --> 00:25:00.265
Baldie, my friend,... do I look angry?

179
00:25:00.692 --> 00:25:02.731
Yes, you do.

180
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:05.291
This is not anger!

181
00:25:05.757 --> 00:25:07.723
Say that I do not get angry!

182
00:25:09.486 --> 00:25:13.276
I do not get angry!

183
00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:28.128
All right, madam. Remove your shoe
and let it be your crowning glory!

184
00:25:33.687 --> 00:25:36.349
Henceforth, do not lay a bet with me.

185
00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:41.239
Why are you showing off? Give
me a chance to prove myself.

186
00:25:41.602 --> 00:25:43.568
All right.

187
00:25:43.924 --> 00:25:45.818
I'll throw the match-box
from this table,...

188
00:25:46.386 --> 00:25:50.320
... and it will land in that man's cup.

189
00:25:55.286 --> 00:26:00.587
Want to bet? If I win, then you'll
have to do whatever I ask you to.

190
00:26:15.442 --> 00:26:19.268
- You'll have to listen to me now.
- Fine. What do I have to do?

191
00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:24.516
You'll have to kiss the first
man who enters the restaurant.

192
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:28.588
It's okay to joke.

193
00:26:28.949 --> 00:26:34.358
Abide by the condition, or let
her say, that she is a coward.

194
00:26:35.738 --> 00:26:38.761
If I have laid a bet, I
will abide by the condition.

195
00:26:47.733 --> 00:26:50.299
- Hey fatso!
- Look at the way you drive!

196
00:27:04.126 --> 00:27:07.280
Hey, listen... I do
not want to eat here.

197
00:27:07.749 --> 00:27:10.520
No, come home!

198
00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:21.464
Where are you going, sweetie?

199
00:27:32.337 --> 00:27:36.870
All right, Madhu. There comes your man!

200
00:28:13.106 --> 00:28:16.548
- What nonsense is this?
- I... I lost the bet.

201
00:28:17.433 --> 00:28:19.855
I was supposed to kiss him.
But you came in the middle.

202
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:23.724
Madam, a spinster gives her
first kiss to her lover,...

203
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:31.635
...to whom she loses her heart,
and not to any passing stranger!

204
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:41.909
- Where are you lost?
- I think she's bowled over!

205
00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:46.165
Deepa, I have found
the prince of my dreams.

206
00:29:00.242 --> 00:29:04.068
Madam, a spinster gives her
first kiss to her lover,...

207
00:29:04.463 --> 00:29:11.492
... to whom she loses her heart,
and not to any passing stranger!

208
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:49.408
We have been here since morning.
But your hero hasn't yet turned up.

209
00:29:49.806 --> 00:29:54.615
- My heart says he'll surely come.
- But how can you win his heart?

210
00:29:55.012 --> 00:29:58.693
I love him, Nisha. And
I will make him mine.

211
00:30:00.218 --> 00:30:03.168
Let alone love you, he won't
even give you a second look.

212
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.924
Want to bet a thousand bucks?

213
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:08.339
One does not lay a bet when
one's heart is at stake.

214
00:30:08.836 --> 00:30:11.078
Why don't you say you lack the guts?

215
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:15.871
- It's an insult. Lay a bet!
- Yes. Go ahead!

216
00:30:16.293 --> 00:30:18.224
Fine. That's a bet.

217
00:30:21.781 --> 00:30:24.203
He has come!

218
00:30:26.706 --> 00:30:32.151
Please tell me what the matter
was. I will not get angry.

219
00:30:33.882 --> 00:30:37.144
Let go of me now, or I'll get angry!

220
00:30:37.857 --> 00:30:40.459
I have escaped from the mental hospital.

221
00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:44.357
Please tell me, what the matter was.

222
00:30:44.822 --> 00:30:52.690
Please tell me, what the matter was.

223
00:31:07.686 --> 00:31:12.783
- I think, she's calling me.
- Not you but the handsome bloke.

224
00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:16.579
Hey, handsome! She is
calling you. Look there.

225
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.349
Say ''hi'' to her.

226
00:31:21.018 --> 00:31:23.332
Did you recognize me? I
am the same one whom you...

227
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:26.715
- Kissed yesterday.
- Kissed?

228
00:31:27.455 --> 00:31:29.914
Shall I come there?... I'll come there.

229
00:31:33.329 --> 00:31:37.935
Your words yesterday have
cast an amazing spell on me.

230
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.617
I cannot think beyond your kiss.

231
00:31:40.013 --> 00:31:41.165
Such a great kiss?

232
00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:50.062
- People are listening.
- So what?

233
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:54.681
Why should anyone mind if we
talk of romance... Do you mind?

234
00:31:54.998 --> 00:31:57.312
- No.
- He does not mind.

235
00:31:58.938 --> 00:32:00.305
You were right yesterday.

236
00:32:00.732 --> 00:32:04.774
A spinster's first
kiss is for her lover.

237
00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:09.169
And I have chosen my lover.

238
00:32:10.475 --> 00:32:14.589
Look! What a daring girl she is!

239
00:32:14.908 --> 00:32:18.315
Madam, neither am I your
lover, nor are you mine.

240
00:32:19.446 --> 00:32:22.672
He asks to be left alone!

241
00:32:23.033 --> 00:32:27.183
Don't consider me an ordinary girl.
I come from a respectable home.

242
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:31.191
I am the sister of the city's
richest man, Rana Mahindra Pratap.

243
00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:32.984
My name is Madhu.

244
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:42.445
- A king and a Queen?
- Yes, this is you and me.

245
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.507
I am a Commerce graduate.
I know 6 languages.

246
00:32:47.868 --> 00:32:50.219
I am 5 feet 6 inches in
height and weigh 55 kilos.

247
00:32:50.612 --> 00:32:52.615
Now, what do you think of me?

248
00:32:54.376 --> 00:32:57.146
Tell her, you think she's good.

249
00:32:57.682 --> 00:33:03.966
- Yes, she is good.
- Then Quickly kiss her.

250
00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:52.785
I had seen Abhishek five years ago.

251
00:38:53.244 --> 00:38:56.890
But he has completely changed
after returning from abroad.

252
00:38:57.958 --> 00:39:01.400
Please forgive me, sir. He
indeed has returned from abroad.

253
00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:05.342
But he has not changed at all.

254
00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:07.841
He has not let the
ways abroad affect him.

255
00:39:09.988 --> 00:39:13.849
Therefore, we have chosen him
for our sister. There comes Madhu.

256
00:39:16.355 --> 00:39:20.325
He is the prince of
Nigampur, Abhishek Sanyal.

257
00:39:20.717 --> 00:39:23.630
This is his uncle, and
she is my sister, Madhu.

258
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.806
Pretty... very pretty!

259
00:39:29.194 --> 00:39:30.524
Monkey!

260
00:39:32.149 --> 00:39:36.010
- Did you say something?
- No.

261
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.936
No... Yes. She was praising you.

262
00:39:39.395 --> 00:39:41.494
Words won't suffice to praise him.

263
00:39:41.822 --> 00:39:45.684
He owns many mills,
factories and palatial homes.

264
00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:53.139
There is a personal zoo too,
behind the mansion where I live.

265
00:39:53.606 --> 00:39:54.974
They must be staying there then!

266
00:39:55.717 --> 00:39:59.159
- Did you say something?
- No... Yes.

267
00:39:59.762 --> 00:40:03.936
She said, that we will
get breakfast for you.

268
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:09.468
You have a very pretty and polite
sister... just like my nephew.

269
00:40:10.175 --> 00:40:12.345
Sister-in-law,
who's that clown?

270
00:40:12.742 --> 00:40:16.951
Don't speak like that. He's from
a royal family and is very rich.

271
00:40:17.386 --> 00:40:19.988
Your brother is fixing
your alliance with him.

272
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.421
- With him?
- Yes.

273
00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:25.043
I won't even employ him
as a servant at home!

274
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.025
- I have chosen my beloved.
- What!

275
00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:36.760
And I have promised to meet him today.

276
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.826
Don't worry. This container
will reach Kolhapur.

277
00:40:40.215 --> 00:40:41.822
And I will personally take these two.

278
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.991
I have to leave early today.
I have to take my wife out.

279
00:40:46.898 --> 00:40:48.445
I also want to leave early today.

280
00:40:48.939 --> 00:40:52.033
Hey, you are not married! What
will you do going home early?

281
00:40:52.527 --> 00:40:56.736
Oh? You are having an
affair? ... Go and enjoy!

282
00:41:00.442 --> 00:41:02.445
Are you going to meet Madhu?

283
00:41:03.748 --> 00:41:07.718
- Who are you?
- Nisha, Madhu's friend.

284
00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.989
I have come to tell you that
Madhu is only putting on a charade.

285
00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:14.370
- What?
- Yes.

286
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:18.547
That rich brat is
fond of fooling people.

287
00:41:18.979 --> 00:41:21.402
This time she has
played the fool on you...

288
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:23.868
... for a bet of Rs.1000 with me.

289
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:26.749
- You are lying!
- Suppose it's the truth?

290
00:41:30.764 --> 00:41:33.677
I will never forgive that rich brat!

291
00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.275
Here's your money, Madhu.

292
00:41:36.883 --> 00:41:39.090
- All of a thousand?
- Yes.

293
00:41:39.522 --> 00:41:42.748
Nobody can win a bet with you.

294
00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.826
You have indeed turned Raja
into a Romeo, in just one day.

295
00:41:47.436 --> 00:41:52.138
I always do what I am determined to do!

296
00:41:54.296 --> 00:41:59.501
I won't keep the money. Go ahead
and enjoy! I'll foot the bill!

297
00:42:02.528 --> 00:42:06.641
Raja?... You?

298
00:42:07.663 --> 00:42:12.436
Don't you dare utter my name!
I know your true colors now!

299
00:42:12.939 --> 00:42:18.600
I admit, I did lay a
bet. But the truth is...

300
00:42:20.221 --> 00:42:23.866
What do you know what love is?
For you, love is only a bet!

301
00:42:24.337 --> 00:42:26.471
A bet of Rs.1000.

302
00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:29.675
Fortunately, Nisha told me the truth.

303
00:42:30.105 --> 00:42:32.912
For I had thought your love to be true.

304
00:42:33.482 --> 00:42:36.217
Don't show me your dirty
face again! Understand?

305
00:42:40.623 --> 00:42:44.773
Raja, please listen to me.
You're misunderstanding me!

306
00:42:45.724 --> 00:42:49.694
She provoked me to lay the bet.

307
00:42:50.297 --> 00:42:51.484
But I really love you.

308
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.864
I do not want to listen to
anything. Stop following me!

309
00:42:55.327 --> 00:42:59.681
Listen to me. Please forgive
me and say that you love me.

310
00:43:07.955 --> 00:43:09.922
- You won't say it?
- Never!

311
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.101
- What are you doing?
- You'll soon know.

312
00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:18.784
Thief! Thief!!

313
00:43:19.282 --> 00:43:25.111
Hey! A thief is stealing the
girl's purse!... Constable!

314
00:43:26.528 --> 00:43:30.498
Not me! There, in the front.

315
00:43:36.272 --> 00:43:38.695
You steal the girl's purse? You thief!

316
00:43:39.122 --> 00:43:43.655
- I am no thief!
- I'm glad you caught him.

317
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:46.393
Madhu, what kind of a joke
is this? Tell them, who I am.

318
00:43:47.036 --> 00:43:49.171
- Do you know him, madam?
- No.

319
00:43:49.569 --> 00:43:52.759
How can a decent girl like
me know a thief like him?

320
00:43:53.192 --> 00:43:56.453
So he is a liar!... Come
on! I'll teach you a lesson!

321
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.732
Excuse me, sir... I want to
talk to the thief in private.

322
00:44:02.478 --> 00:44:05.668
Raja, there is still
time. Say that you love me.

323
00:44:06.523 --> 00:44:10.242
I will not say that,
even if I am hanged!

324
00:44:11.062 --> 00:44:13.761
Take him away! He says,
he will not get reformed!

325
00:44:17.007 --> 00:44:19.633
Why did you have Raja
thrown behind bars?

326
00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:22.489
What else could I do? He was
not ready to say, ''I love you''.

327
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:26.359
You have dug your own grave!
Now he will hate you forever!

328
00:44:27.278 --> 00:44:30.468
- What do I do now?
- Captivate his family.

329
00:44:30.866 --> 00:44:32.544
You mean, send them also to prison?

330
00:44:33.363 --> 00:44:36.589
Idiot! I mean, win them over!

331
00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:44.615
I will! Everyone will be
astonished at the way I do that!

332
00:44:45.956 --> 00:44:48.307
Abdul was saying that Raja
did not return home at night.

333
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.507
Yes. That is why I am very anxious.

334
00:44:52.006 --> 00:44:55.448
Oh dear! When a young boy
disappears from home at night,...

335
00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.935
... then assume, something is wrong.

336
00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:01.566
Shut up, you fool! You
always talk nonsense!

337
00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:06.700
- Did you inQuire at his factory?
- Yes. He didn't go to work either.

338
00:45:07.308 --> 00:45:11.554
Oh God! Then where did he go?

339
00:45:11.951 --> 00:45:16.832
I'll tell you. He was with me all night.

340
00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:20.033
- But who are you?
- My Raja's beloved.

341
00:45:21.098 --> 00:45:24.156
Now you will ask, how the story began.

342
00:45:25.037 --> 00:45:28.756
Auntie, this story is two years old.

343
00:45:29.223 --> 00:45:31.753
Oh my God! You've known
Raja for two years?

344
00:45:32.107 --> 00:45:36.569
Yes. We've been treading the
path of love for two years.

345
00:45:36.927 --> 00:45:39.241
But last night...

346
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.770
... there was an accident.

347
00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:51.309
Yes. An accident where two pairs
of eyes and two hearts clashed.

348
00:45:53.073 --> 00:45:53.588
How?

349
00:45:54.023 --> 00:45:59.396
It was night time and it
was pouring incessantly.

350
00:46:00.108 --> 00:46:02.530
We were near some old ruins.

351
00:46:03.168 --> 00:46:07.810
Both of us were
shivering due to the cold.

352
00:46:08.234 --> 00:46:13.463
Raja somehow... lit the fire.

353
00:46:14.213 --> 00:46:19.346
On one side, the fires
raged. On the other, we too.

354
00:46:19.736 --> 00:46:23.455
Somewhere in the distant,
a song was playing...

355
00:46:24.098 --> 00:46:28.907
''You are so bewitching
insanity grips my love''

356
00:46:29.339 --> 00:46:33.129
''I fear, things may go beyond control''

357
00:46:33.526 --> 00:46:37.496
Shut up!... Then what happened?

358
00:46:38.098 --> 00:46:42.068
Then he looked at me like
the actor, Dilip Kumar.

359
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:44.879
I smiled like the actress, Vyjantimala.

360
00:46:45.274 --> 00:46:48.152
Then he winked at me like Rajesh Khanna.

361
00:46:48.792 --> 00:46:50.722
I felt coy like Sharmila.

362
00:46:51.148 --> 00:46:56.810
Then he caught my hand like
Amitabh. I got restless like Rekha.

363
00:46:57.304 --> 00:47:00.746
He was overwhelmed with
emotion. I got scared.

364
00:47:01.174 --> 00:47:04.616
He embraced me like Dharmendra.
I tried to break free...

365
00:47:04.972 --> 00:47:07.599
... like Hema, but...

366
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:09.544
But what happened?

367
00:47:10.003 --> 00:47:14.609
''Your loved one has lost her chastity''

368
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:19.352
'' By cleansing the
sinners of their sins''

369
00:47:29.878 --> 00:47:32.972
Goodness me! Lmplying
'everything happened' ?

370
00:47:33.536 --> 00:47:41.093
Yes. Then he walked out on me
in the morning, like a villain.

371
00:47:48.662 --> 00:47:51.685
I cannot show my face to anyone now.

372
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:56.463
If Raja does not accept
me, I will kill myself!

373
00:47:56.858 --> 00:47:57.900
I'll kill myself!

374
00:48:05.195 --> 00:48:07.929
Hey, nobody is looking?...
Look! I will kill myself!

375
00:48:14.235 --> 00:48:17.953
- No. You will have to live.
- Hey! Raja has come!

376
00:48:18.597 --> 00:48:20.839
I will set him right today!

377
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:28.515
It is your family problem.
You resolve it. I'll go inside.

378
00:48:28.834 --> 00:48:29.780
All right.

379
00:48:30.416 --> 00:48:33.930
Greetings! What's the
matter? You look very fresh.

380
00:48:34.461 --> 00:48:35.792
Am I looking fresh?

381
00:48:37.416 --> 00:48:39.730
- I had a harrowing time last night.
- I know.

382
00:48:40.406 --> 00:48:41.809
Where were you last night?

383
00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:45.084
Get lost!

384
00:48:45.893 --> 00:48:49.863
Go inside! You will
have to face the music!

385
00:48:57.713 --> 00:48:59.644
You have disgraced yourself!

386
00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:04.772
Oh God! How did they get to
know I was in jail last night?

387
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.698
You mean, you know
where I was last night?

388
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:13.644
We have the full report.

389
00:49:14.035 --> 00:49:18.280
Auntie, it is not my
fault. That girl trapped me.

390
00:49:18.713 --> 00:49:21.699
- That girl must have trapped him.
- Shut up.

391
00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.439
Is he a small boy to get misled?

392
00:49:24.833 --> 00:49:27.568
Didn't you feel ashamed
to outrage her modesty?

393
00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:31.622
Come on, auntie! My honor
has been lost, not hers.

394
00:49:32.397 --> 00:49:37.386
Bravo! You eat the fruit,
and throw the skin on others!

395
00:49:37.744 --> 00:49:41.221
Let alone fruits, I did not
get to eat anything in there.

396
00:49:41.648 --> 00:49:44.107
- I slept hungry in the
lock-up. - In the lock-up?

397
00:49:44.497 --> 00:49:46.596
Yes, auntie. Do you know why?

398
00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:51.735
Because I did not tell her,
I love her. So she trapped me.

399
00:49:52.271 --> 00:49:54.873
I swear, if I meet her anywhere,...

400
00:49:55.261 --> 00:49:58.415
...l'll land her in
a deplorable condition!

401
00:49:58.744 --> 00:50:00.147
I shall not let her alive!

402
00:50:00.468 --> 00:50:01.726
Be calm and drink water.

403
00:50:04.758 --> 00:50:06.724
You? What are you doing here?

404
00:50:07.186 --> 00:50:11.996
Auntie, she's the girl who had
trapped me... Speak the truth!

405
00:50:12.392 --> 00:50:14.358
- Say or...
- I'll tell!

406
00:50:14.749 --> 00:50:21.430
Whatever I told you were lies.

407
00:50:21.924 --> 00:50:26.074
The truth is, that I love Raja a lot.

408
00:50:26.532 --> 00:50:28.427
But he does not love me.

409
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.019
All's fair in love and war, isn't it?

410
00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:34.548
What would you have done in my place?

411
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.799
We would have done the same thing.

412
00:50:37.261 --> 00:50:40.739
Hey! That's enough! And get out of here.

413
00:50:41.306 --> 00:50:44.077
Get out!

414
00:50:45.458 --> 00:50:49.776
Hey! Do not push her! She is my sister!

415
00:50:50.242 --> 00:50:53.960
Hey, you take care of your sister!

416
00:50:54.427 --> 00:50:57.522
Where are you going?... Get out!

417
00:56:57.412 --> 00:57:02.473
You are an amazing girl! A while
back, you were merrily dancing.

418
00:57:02.864 --> 00:57:04.375
And now you are crying.

419
00:57:08.562 --> 00:57:14.500
Tell me something. You
love Raja a lot, don't you?

420
00:57:15.316 --> 00:57:20.797
Don't worry. I'll make
things work for you.

421
00:57:23.407 --> 00:57:26.813
For this, I will have to act a little.

422
00:57:29.105 --> 00:57:32.967
''I have blossomed into my youth today''

423
00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:37.859
''I have bloomed from
a bud into a flower''

424
00:57:40.502 --> 00:57:43.380
You had me frightened.

425
00:57:45.849 --> 00:57:50.131
I am in love with you.

426
00:57:51.582 --> 00:57:54.077
How did this change take place?

427
00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:58.183
Now I will demonstrate
the change to you.

428
00:57:58.829 --> 00:58:01.671
It was different when we
were young. I loved you then.

429
00:58:02.066 --> 00:58:04.728
But now, I am in love with someone else.

430
00:58:05.056 --> 00:58:09.026
What? You love someone
else when I'm around?

431
00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:14.408
Before you disgrace yourself,
I'll get married to you. Come on!

432
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:18.976
- What are you doing?
- I am going to marry him.

433
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:22.880
- Come to the temple.
- You'll come home with me!

434
00:58:23.945 --> 00:58:26.752
- I am his husband, Raja.
- What rubbish!

435
00:58:27.146 --> 00:58:29.533
He will become a widow.

436
00:58:36.081 --> 00:58:39.175
- What's wrong with brother?
- I do not know.

437
00:58:39.528 --> 00:58:41.915
He came home in the morning
complaining of a stomach ache.

438
00:58:42.272 --> 00:58:46.517
So my aunt, who has come from
the village, gave him a syrup.

439
00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:54.396
Yes. This is the bottle.
Birju drank all of it.

440
00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:58.727
- It's the effect of the medicine.
- But where is your aunt?

441
00:59:00.775 --> 00:59:01.854
Aunt!

442
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:13.146
Hey, son! Can't you
see where you're going?

443
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:15.960
- Who are you?
- She is Madhu.

444
00:59:16.604 --> 00:59:20.118
Aunt... Aunt Madhu!

445
00:59:20.544 --> 00:59:23.770
Hey, auntie! My brother
is behaving abnormally.

446
00:59:24.131 --> 00:59:26.793
- What medicine did you give him?
- What did I give?

447
00:59:27.439 --> 00:59:30.425
- Hey! Did he drink all of it?
- Yes.

448
00:59:30.886 --> 00:59:33.057
Oh God! I gave the wrong medicine.

449
00:59:34.157 --> 00:59:37.635
The effect is Quite disastrous.

450
00:59:38.378 --> 00:59:40.657
Its effect will not wear
off for a week or so.

451
00:59:41.087 --> 00:59:43.401
- What?! For a week or so?
- Yes.

452
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.763
- But there must be a solution.
- There is.

453
00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:48.359
But one has to go to the
jungle to get the herbs.

454
00:59:48.755 --> 00:59:50.194
Then come with me.

455
00:59:50.584 --> 00:59:54.374
You aren't my husband,
that I'd go with you.

456
00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:58.141
- I shall not come.
- You will have to!

457
00:59:58.534 --> 01:00:01.412
If you do not come, then I
will pick you up and take you.

458
01:00:01.911 --> 01:00:06.517
- You will take me forcefully?
- Yes!

459
01:00:08.454 --> 01:00:12.460
Then pick me up!

460
01:00:13.519 --> 01:00:17.669
- Aunt, leave me alone! Listen...
- Damn you!

461
01:00:18.303 --> 01:00:21.674
Do not act tough with me.

462
01:00:22.172 --> 01:00:29.021
Quietly go the jungle,
or I will sock you! Fatso!

463
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:34.867
Hey, you scoundrel! You call me a fatso?

464
01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.396
Do I eat from your earnings? You donkey!

465
01:00:39.901 --> 01:00:44.183
You call me a fatso? ... Get lost!

466
01:00:45.178 --> 01:00:50.347
Drunkard! Do I eat from
your earnings?... Leave me!

467
01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:56.467
Aunt, I beg of you to let
go of him, or he will die.

468
01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:59.563
Since you are asking me so lovingly,...

469
01:00:59.987 --> 01:01:02.265
... I'll let go of this rat!

470
01:01:04.841 --> 01:01:05.993
Ass!

471
01:01:06.636 --> 01:01:09.585
If anyone talks to me lovingly,...

472
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.597
... then I can do anything for him.

473
01:01:14.234 --> 01:01:18.347
Come on. Let's go to the jungle.

474
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.222
Now will be the fun.

475
01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:37.684
I am fed up of driving in the hills.

476
01:01:38.082 --> 01:01:39.377
Where will I get the herbs?

477
01:01:39.842 --> 01:01:45.251
There is no gain without
pain, is there, my Raja?

478
01:01:46.032 --> 01:01:48.203
- What... what are you doing?
- Shall I say something?

479
01:01:48.742 --> 01:01:51.164
I like you a lot!

480
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:58.271
That's enough! If I get angry, then...

481
01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:31.117
Scoundrels!

482
01:04:39.804 --> 01:04:42.610
- What are you doing, aunt?
- Where did you get hurt?

483
01:04:43.075 --> 01:04:45.078
That does not matter.

484
01:05:55.679 --> 01:06:00.740
What nonsense is this? Aren't
you ashamed of doing this?

485
01:06:02.854 --> 01:06:05.625
She will not improve! She will not!

486
01:06:12.388 --> 01:06:17.521
The tire is flat! The city
is 200 kilometers. Away.

487
01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:20.326
Let's make merry!

488
01:06:20.794 --> 01:06:24.236
Nothing doing! I shall make
arrangements to leave now.

489
01:06:46.297 --> 01:07:54.883
Irrespective of what you
say, it's all your fault.

490
01:07:55.594 --> 01:07:59.839
If you had agreed, there'd have
been no need for the charade.

491
01:08:00.203 --> 01:08:02.097
And we would not have had
to get trapped in a jungle.

492
01:08:03.087 --> 01:08:07.237
There's still time.
Admit, that you love me!

493
01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:09.761
Why do you keep harping on love?

494
01:08:10.263 --> 01:08:12.649
- Do you love me a lot?
- Yes, Raja.

495
01:08:14.484 --> 01:08:16.271
Will you do...

496
01:08:16.912 --> 01:08:22.212
- ... what I ask you to?
- Try me.

497
01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:29.711
- Then strip!
- No!

498
01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:32.975
I want to love you.

499
01:08:34.394 --> 01:08:35.269
Right now.

500
01:08:39.037 --> 01:08:42.586
No, Raja! This is no way to love.

501
01:08:42.942 --> 01:08:44.165
It's my way.

502
01:08:44.736 --> 01:08:51.693
You want to win me over? Then
you must comply with my wishes.

503
01:08:52.158 --> 01:08:54.724
- You'll have to surrender to me.
- No, Raja.

504
01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:58.375
Ask for my life, but...

505
01:08:58.771 --> 01:09:02.106
I do not want your life, but your body!

506
01:09:02.465 --> 01:09:09.385
No!

507
01:09:09.922 --> 01:09:12.944
No!

508
01:09:13.264 --> 01:09:18.744
I knew, your love was only a pretense.

509
01:09:23.676 --> 01:09:26.135
Listen to me, Raja.

510
01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:41.398
You are a farce, and so is your love.

511
01:09:44.746 --> 01:09:46.712
Wait, Raja!

512
01:09:53.224 --> 01:09:57.338
If this is the only
way to win your love,...

513
01:09:57.796 --> 01:10:00.495
If this is the meaning
of love for you,...

514
01:10:00.998 --> 01:10:03.073
If lust is the criterion
of your love,...

515
01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:07.317
... then take this body!

516
01:10:07.822 --> 01:10:10.976
Come and satiate the fires of your lust.

517
01:10:11.762 --> 01:10:16.331
Cross your limits and
take away my chastity!

518
01:10:50.069 --> 01:10:56.678
Madhu, your chastity means
more to me than my own life.

519
01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:59.561
Lust is not the criterion of my love.

520
01:11:00.058 --> 01:11:03.536
Nor have I forgotten my limits.

521
01:11:04.034 --> 01:11:10.427
I have deeply wronged by
not trusting your love.

522
01:11:10.929 --> 01:11:14.574
Forgive me, Madhu.

523
01:11:23.205 --> 01:11:26.791
Madhu, when my name is 'Raja'(king)...

524
01:11:27.214 --> 01:11:33.536
... then why didn't your
folks name you 'Rani'(Queen)?

525
01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:47.433
When his name is Raja,
why isn't mine Rani?

526
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.978
Yes. Your childhood friend.

527
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.019
I am very happy today.

528
01:16:50.555 --> 01:16:54.178
Thank God that both of you are united.

529
01:16:54.635 --> 01:16:58.713
It had to happen. The alliance
that you had fixed in childhood...

530
01:16:59.174 --> 01:17:01.872
... had to be realized.

531
01:17:02.901 --> 01:17:08.382
Yes, brother. She is
Madhu, my childhood friend.

532
01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.800
Bless you, dear.

533
01:17:25.661 --> 01:17:29.067
You do not know, your brothers...

534
01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:35.577
Raju told me everything. I know
why the alliance was broken.

535
01:17:36.002 --> 01:17:38.568
Therefore we have decided
to have a court marriage.

536
01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.746
No, Raja! No!

537
01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:43.799
It will be wrong.

538
01:17:44.444 --> 01:17:50.177
I will go to my friend to
resurrect this broken alliance.

539
01:17:52.113 --> 01:17:55.939
I can't believe, that the
auspicious time would come so soon.

540
01:17:56.441 --> 01:17:59.247
We'll leave now. We have to make
arrangements for the engagement.

541
01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.258
There is a lot of work to do. Greetings!

542
01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:06.956
Hurry up, driver.

543
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:36.144
Oh? So he is your brother?

544
01:18:36.471 --> 01:18:39.697
Yes. He is our Raja.

545
01:18:41.642 --> 01:18:47.999
Won't you invite your friend inside?

546
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:52.016
You are far below my status
to step into my house.

547
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.735
Mr. Rana!

548
01:18:55.853 --> 01:19:01.406
You do not know that Raja
and Madhu love each other.

549
01:19:01.798 --> 01:19:03.369
I know it very well!

550
01:19:05.104 --> 01:19:08.258
My sister has fallen
in love with a boy...

551
01:19:08.762 --> 01:19:12.276
... whose home I would
not even like to step into!

552
01:19:12.772 --> 01:19:21.312
It's a fact, that we are
poor and ordinary people.

553
01:19:21.672 --> 01:19:25.714
But people in love are oblivious
to any kind of discrimination.

554
01:19:26.069 --> 01:19:30.279
The truth is that marriages
are made in heaven.

555
01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:33.172
Not in heaven! They are made here!

556
01:19:33.562 --> 01:19:36.440
You intentionally had your brother
trap my sister in his love...

557
01:19:36.868 --> 01:19:39.638
... so that you could settle old scores!

558
01:19:40.034 --> 01:19:42.733
- No, brother. It's a lie.
- It is the truth!

559
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:45.513
It is a conspiracy of his dirty mind!

560
01:19:47.105 --> 01:19:50.859
I had heard that there are
some wicked men in the world.

561
01:19:51.361 --> 01:19:54.167
But you are the worst of them all!

562
01:19:57.552 --> 01:20:02.326
I can give a fitting
reply to your impertinence.

563
01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:08.620
But I am not fond of
throwing stones in muck!

564
01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:12.457
And you must also
listen to me carefully.

565
01:20:12.994 --> 01:20:16.472
You are getting engaged
to Abhishek tomorrow.

566
01:20:17.005 --> 01:20:21.886
If anyone tries to obstruct
this auspicious occasion,...

567
01:20:22.316 --> 01:20:25.794
...irrespective of whether
it's a bier or a palanQuin,...

568
01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.642
... it will leave with great splendor!

569
01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:48.651
Ladies and gentlemen, I would
like your attention please.

570
01:20:49.683 --> 01:20:54.780
Every year on this day, you
assemble in this mansion.

571
01:20:55.277 --> 01:21:00.014
Because I celebrate my sister's
birthday with great splendor.

572
01:21:00.412 --> 01:21:03.566
But today, there is
another reason to celebrate.

573
01:21:04.282 --> 01:21:07.724
I announce my only sister,
Madhu's engagement...

574
01:21:08.222 --> 01:21:11.735
... with the prince
of Nigampur, Abhishek.

575
01:21:16.945 --> 01:21:20.459
- Call Madhu.
- I will.

576
01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:05.092
Why are you so shocked?
Brother's announcement is true.

577
01:22:05.594 --> 01:22:09.420
I will get engaged,
but the bridegroom...

578
01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:12.201
... will not be a prince of any kingdom.

579
01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.345
It'll be the king of my heart.

580
01:22:15.548 --> 01:22:19.446
- What nonsense is this?
- It is my decision, brother.

581
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.191
Who are you to decide about your life?

582
01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:25.915
Only I have the right to
make decisions in this house!

583
01:22:29.513 --> 01:22:35.414
I am leaving the house where I
cannot live the way I want to!

584
01:22:42.529 --> 01:22:47.446
You are disgracing us before
others for this scoundrel?

585
01:22:47.875 --> 01:22:51.029
Let me see how he
leaves this place alive.

586
01:22:51.815 --> 01:22:55.988
Then shoot! But the bullet
will first pierce your sister!

587
01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.859
Shoot!

588
01:23:00.328 --> 01:23:02.534
Shoot if you have the guts!

589
01:23:08.841 --> 01:23:12.738
- No! Have you gone crazy?
- Yes! I will kill her!

590
01:23:13.132 --> 01:23:16.430
- So who has stopped you? Shoot!
- Yes, I will!

591
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:23.216
And you! You are ready
to get shot for him.

592
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.370
Ask him once, what he can do for you!

593
01:23:27.976 --> 01:23:30.075
Ask!

594
01:23:33.147 --> 01:23:36.241
You are disgracing your
ancestors' honor for him.

595
01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.034
Ask him, what he can do for you!

596
01:23:44.192 --> 01:23:48.930
You are forsaking 20 years
of our love for his sake!

597
01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:53.189
Ask him, what he can do for you!

598
01:24:07.234 --> 01:24:11.131
Ask him, whether he can
traverse the distance...

599
01:24:11.524 --> 01:24:14.150
... of 20 steps, barefoot? Ask him!

600
01:24:33.298 --> 01:24:36.921
No, Raja! You will not do it!

601
01:24:59.751 --> 01:25:01.262
Leave me!

602
01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.318
No!

603
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:07.531
Look! Your love has accepted
defeat walking just four steps!

604
01:26:07.958 --> 01:26:09.924
How can he be with you
for a life long journey?

605
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:14.919
Falling in love is no child's play!

606
01:26:15.556 --> 01:26:18.578
Even the mightiest crumble!

607
01:28:06.995 --> 01:28:12.199
Never test the ones truly in love!

608
01:28:12.658 --> 01:28:16.556
Love has made the mightiest bow!

609
01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:21.309
Wow! What a couplet!

610
01:28:26.517 --> 01:28:30.163
Give my Madhu's hand in mine.

611
01:28:34.854 --> 01:28:41.211
Swine! Scoundrel!

612
01:28:43.824 --> 01:28:46.847
Lock her up in her room.

613
01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:52.994
Hey! Throw him in the
very gutters he came from!

614
01:29:03.875 --> 01:29:06.969
Hey, he is Raja!

615
01:29:07.779 --> 01:29:10.477
What?... No!

616
01:29:30.257 --> 01:29:33.627
Open your eyes.

617
01:29:36.694 --> 01:29:38.133
What happened?

618
01:29:39.402 --> 01:29:45.628
Oh God! Who is the swine
who did this to my Raja?

619
01:29:47.176 --> 01:29:51.710
Auntie, I know who has hit my brother.

620
01:29:53.368 --> 01:29:58.106
I will not spare him!

621
01:29:59.313 --> 01:30:02.791
I will not spare him!

622
01:30:17.006 --> 01:30:19.608
Hey! Where are you barging in?

623
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:25.692
Hey, come down!

624
01:30:26.151 --> 01:30:28.430
Come out, you scoundrel!

625
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:34.586
Come on down, you scoundrel!

626
01:30:36.072 --> 01:30:39.862
If you have the guts, then come down!

627
01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:44.292
Swine! You come to our
house and challenge us!

628
01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.496
Stay there! I'll be there!

629
01:30:48.102 --> 01:30:50.908
Come on down! I'll send you up!

630
01:30:51.654 --> 01:31:00.231
You don't know, how to talk! Swine...

631
01:31:10.544 --> 01:31:17.045
Brother, help!

632
01:31:23.805 --> 01:31:27.979
Brother, call the police! Save me!

633
01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:34.634
This is Rana Mahindra Pratap speaking.

634
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:53.986
Look at what he has done to my
brother. Arrest this lowly man!

635
01:31:54.514 --> 01:31:56.157
You must be lowly!

636
01:31:56.801 --> 01:31:57.988
Come to your senses!

637
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:06.717
You do not know, he hit my brother.

638
01:32:07.776 --> 01:32:12.418
They beat him black
and blue, and threw him!

639
01:32:13.053 --> 01:32:17.443
I shall not spare you! I shall not!

640
01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:20.860
Get lost! How can you harm me, madman?

641
01:32:21.248 --> 01:32:23.814
Then hear the challenge of a madman.

642
01:32:25.117 --> 01:32:29.891
If I do not get your sister
married to my brother,...

643
01:32:30.359 --> 01:32:35.037
... then I will be damned!

644
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:41.331
I'll hack your brother to
pieces before this happens!

645
01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:44.886
Let alone hacking him to pieces,...

646
01:32:45.344 --> 01:32:48.679
Even if you raise a
finger at my brother,...

647
01:32:49.108 --> 01:32:51.530
... then your state will be such...

648
01:32:51.992 --> 01:32:57.653
... that you won't be counted as
a man, nor accepted as an eunuch!

649
01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:19.142
I still cannot fathom,
who could have beaten...

650
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:20.903
... our Raja so mercilessly?

651
01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.502
If I come to know who it is...

652
01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:28.742
... then, I swear by God,
I will slaughter him...

653
01:33:29.174 --> 01:33:30.997
... the way a butcher slaughters a goat!

654
01:33:32.305 --> 01:33:35.986
- What's wrong with him?
- Something bad happened.

655
01:33:37.124 --> 01:33:38.382
What happened?

656
01:33:38.847 --> 01:33:42.673
The police arrested
Birju. He is in jail.

657
01:33:42.998 --> 01:33:46.476
- What?
- That's real bad news.

658
01:33:47.466 --> 01:33:50.800
So Raja should not hear of this.

659
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:53.472
Or his condition may deteriorate.

660
01:33:54.008 --> 01:33:56.995
But how will we get Birju released?

661
01:33:57.490 --> 01:34:01.424
The Inspector demands
a bail of Rs. 15,000.

662
01:34:01.817 --> 01:34:03.364
I will not accept a bail, Mr. Rana,...

663
01:34:03.752 --> 01:34:06.486
... even if I'm given Rs.1,00,000.

664
01:34:06.883 --> 01:34:08.957
He broke a lot of glass in your mansion.

665
01:34:09.275 --> 01:34:11.697
If I do not break that
many bones of his,...

666
01:34:12.124 --> 01:34:14.859
... then I will be damned!

667
01:34:15.536 --> 01:34:20.705
You talk of 6 months. He will
rot here for around 10 years.

668
01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:26.542
Yes, sir. I received your
bundle. Now, my job begins.

669
01:34:32.244 --> 01:34:35.686
All of you share this. The rest is mine.

670
01:34:36.465 --> 01:34:39.908
That's fine. But we should
not keep the money here.

671
01:34:40.406 --> 01:34:41.665
We have just got information,...

672
01:34:42.059 --> 01:34:45.189
... that the Anti-Corruption
Bureau is going to raid the place.

673
01:34:45.576 --> 01:34:49.786
If they catch us with the
bribe, we'll be sacked, sir.

674
01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:53.804
- Do something, sir.
- Take this money to my house.

675
01:34:54.195 --> 01:34:56.017
- Just a minute.
- What is it?

676
01:34:56.552 --> 01:34:59.958
- Please come here.
- Tell me. What is it?

677
01:35:00.315 --> 01:35:01.790
Sir, give me your hand.

678
01:35:02.602 --> 01:35:05.937
- Are you an astrologer?
- Sir, please give me your hand.

679
01:35:06.507 --> 01:35:10.825
Take a good look! You'll
get beaten with it!

680
01:35:11.326 --> 01:35:14.623
You have a good hand... Five fingers.

681
01:35:15.442 --> 01:35:21.630
Hey, leave my hand! My hand!

682
01:35:21.984 --> 01:35:23.627
Help!

683
01:35:24.129 --> 01:35:27.811
Hey, you fools! Where are all of you?

684
01:35:31.411 --> 01:35:34.217
How did you enjoy? You will beat me?

685
01:35:34.858 --> 01:35:38.648
My baton! Pandey, get my
baton... Open the cell.

686
01:35:39.185 --> 01:35:41.787
Nobody dare move from their place!

687
01:35:42.211 --> 01:35:44.177
We have come from the
Anti Corruption Bureau.

688
01:35:45.059 --> 01:35:49.377
Welcome, sir. You won't find anyone
corrupt in this police-station.

689
01:35:49.774 --> 01:35:51.596
Everybody is honest here.

690
01:35:52.024 --> 01:35:55.850
Don't heed him. Even when he wanted
to come out of his mother's womb,...

691
01:35:56.211 --> 01:35:58.705
... he had asked for a bribe
from his father. Don't spare him!

692
01:35:59.235 --> 01:36:01.801
Hey! You keep shut!

693
01:36:02.225 --> 01:36:04.720
We know what we have to do. Understand?

694
01:36:06.904 --> 01:36:09.075
Search him.

695
01:36:29.417 --> 01:36:33.063
I found it! I found it!!

696
01:36:34.096 --> 01:36:36.171
How should I punish you for this?

697
01:36:36.628 --> 01:36:38.942
Sir, tie his hands and feet,
and putjaggery on him...

698
01:36:39.336 --> 01:36:42.395
... so that the ants eat him up!

699
01:36:43.276 --> 01:36:46.611
Sir, please forgive me. This
mistake will not be repeated.

700
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:48.265
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

701
01:36:48.623 --> 01:36:51.646
- Then release the innocent man.
- All right.

702
01:36:51.1000 --> 01:36:55.297
Harpal, Quickly unlock the
door and bring Mr.Birju out.

703
01:36:55.694 --> 01:36:58.045
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

704
01:36:58.684 --> 01:37:01.070
Nobody dare move from their place!

705
01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:02.935
But who are you?

706
01:37:03.573 --> 01:37:06.944
We have come from the
Anti-Corruption Bureau.

707
01:37:27.247 --> 01:37:31.853
- What is this drama?
- Release our brother. He's innocent.

708
01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:35.009
Silence! Who are you?
Why are you crying?

709
01:37:35.477 --> 01:37:39.123
He arrested our brother for no reason.

710
01:37:39.524 --> 01:37:42.473
And he is demanding Rs.50,000
as bribe for his release.

711
01:37:42.864 --> 01:37:45.215
We have given him 50,000.
Now the fool demands 75,000.

712
01:37:45.643 --> 01:37:47.466
Sir, they are lying! I will...

713
01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:51.121
- Where did the money come from?
- This is not a bribe. I...

714
01:37:51.553 --> 01:37:54.648
Seal his mouth.

715
01:37:55.317 --> 01:37:57.488
Constable... release the innocent man.

716
01:37:58.061 --> 01:38:07.129
Thank you very much for
releasing a poor man like me.

717
01:38:08.509 --> 01:38:11.567
- Shall I take my money, sir?
- You may.

718
01:38:14.735 --> 01:38:17.049
Come on everybody!

719
01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:22.606
I shall teach this
dishonest man a lesson.

720
01:38:23.915 --> 01:38:30.141
Raja, are you okay?

721
01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:33.935
I am okay, brother. But you
should not have gone there.

722
01:38:34.539 --> 01:38:37.453
- Suppose something happened to you?
- Nothing will happen to me.

723
01:38:37.916 --> 01:38:40.374
Harm will befall only those scoundrels.

724
01:38:40.765 --> 01:38:44.100
- The battle is mine.
- No, it is ours.

725
01:38:44.565 --> 01:38:45.787
Don't be crazy.

726
01:38:46.252 --> 01:38:51.805
They have money, power and people.
You cannot win against them.

727
01:38:52.162 --> 01:38:54.824
We will certainly win, auntie.

728
01:38:55.328 --> 01:38:59.226
By might, mind or deceit.

729
01:38:59.831 --> 01:39:01.870
I will openly laud...

730
01:39:02.363 --> 01:39:07.280
... whatever you have done to Raja.

731
01:39:07.886 --> 01:39:10.452
That madman gave big talks.

732
01:39:11.016 --> 01:39:14.698
Watch, he will not even
look at the mansion now.

733
01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:21.109
Hey! Talk of the devil,
and the devil appears!

734
01:39:24.067 --> 01:39:27.748
Swine! How dare you enter in! Get out!

735
01:39:29.414 --> 01:39:35.639
You are like a lit bomb...
ready to explode anytime!

736
01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:41.996
I am not here to fight, but
to give Raja's wedding card.

737
01:39:42.922 --> 01:39:47.731
You look Quite mad,
but are Quite sensible.

738
01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:53.150
It's good, you fixed your
brother's marriage elsewhere.

739
01:39:54.424 --> 01:39:57.795
- Get him almond sherbet.
- With saffron.

740
01:39:58.188 --> 01:40:01.666
Yes, with saffron...
Where is the girl from?

741
01:40:02.374 --> 01:40:05.397
From here itself... By your grace...

742
01:40:05.891 --> 01:40:08.457
... the alliance has been
fixed with a rich family.

743
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:11.652
- You also read it.
- Fantastic!

744
01:40:14.439 --> 01:40:18.829
Birju Patangwala invites
you for his brother, Raja...

745
01:40:19.259 --> 01:40:22.844
... and Madhu, Mr. Mahindra
Pratap Gadwal's sister...

746
01:40:25.836 --> 01:40:30.262
Swine! How could you do such
a cheap trick and come here?

747
01:40:30.867 --> 01:40:34.585
Isn't it a custom to give the
first card to the bride's family?

748
01:40:34.947 --> 01:40:38.389
Scoundrel! You fix an alliance with us?

749
01:40:38.992 --> 01:40:40.958
You will not go out alive from here!

750
01:40:43.987 --> 01:40:47.429
I shall not spare you alive!

751
01:40:47.821 --> 01:40:49.044
That's good!

752
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:52.881
Shoot me. You will
make things easy for me.

753
01:40:53.274 --> 01:40:57.880
Idiot! How can things become
easy for you if you die?

754
01:40:58.305 --> 01:41:00.308
You stupid fool, you do not understand!

755
01:41:00.766 --> 01:41:06.031
He will shoot me; I'll die. Both
of them will be hanged to death.

756
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:10.855
Madhu and Raja's way
will be cleared. Shoot me!

757
01:41:11.214 --> 01:41:13.984
He is right, sir! Do not shoot him!

758
01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:18.388
Do not shoot!

759
01:41:18.742 --> 01:41:21.308
Do not shoot!

760
01:41:45.617 --> 01:41:48.111
Try to understand. He is right.

761
01:41:48.606 --> 01:41:52.084
He has done half the job
by printing the cards.

762
01:41:52.546 --> 01:41:55.496
The remaining, he will
do after your death.

763
01:41:55.888 --> 01:41:57.987
It's good, you did not shoot him.

764
01:41:59.722 --> 01:42:05.167
You are the only sensible one
amongst them. The others are foolish.

765
01:42:06.194 --> 01:42:08.053
- You fool!
- Yes?

766
01:42:08.517 --> 01:42:09.884
Come here.

767
01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.826
I do not know about the others.

768
01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:20.574
But you look like a human being.

769
01:42:20.933 --> 01:42:23.668
I will give you an advice
for free. Accept it.

770
01:42:24.099 --> 01:42:26.870
Remove all thoughts about Madhu.

771
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:30.993
Or you will be in such a state...

772
01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:33.310
... that you will not
be counted as a man,...

773
01:42:33.667 --> 01:42:36.654
... nor accepted as an eunuch.

774
01:42:43.763 --> 01:42:52.195
Mr. Rana, our next meeting will
be on the 25th of October,...

775
01:42:54.632 --> 01:42:59.622
Brother, he came to our
house and threatened us?

776
01:43:00.084 --> 01:43:03.382
I swear, never
underestimate your enemies.

777
01:43:03.778 --> 01:43:05.182
The madman can do anything.

778
01:43:05.572 --> 01:43:10.381
Uncle is right. There are 25
days more for the 25th of October.

779
01:43:10.743 --> 01:43:12.565
The madman can do anything.

780
01:43:13.064 --> 01:43:15.835
So let's take Madhu
somewhere else for 25 days.

781
01:43:16.511 --> 01:43:19.534
I have a bungalow 25
miles away from Alibaug.

782
01:43:19.924 --> 01:43:23.570
We'll take Madhu there and
get her and Abhishek married.

783
01:43:23.899 --> 01:43:26.885
Then we will see how the
madman claps with one hand!

784
01:43:31.567 --> 01:43:33.138
All right.

785
01:43:33.959 --> 01:43:38.240
Madhu will see the rising
sun tomorrow only at Alibaug.

786
01:43:49.612 --> 01:43:51.291
Do not worry.

787
01:43:51.759 --> 01:43:55.272
Nobody can separate Madhu from Raja.

788
01:43:58.547 --> 01:44:01.077
Sit Quietly, Madhu!

789
01:44:02.557 --> 01:44:07.438
Nobody can separate me
from Raja. Untie my hands.

790
01:44:07.764 --> 01:44:09.587
- Sit!
- No!

791
01:44:21.834 --> 01:44:23.345
Driver, faster!

792
01:44:33.758 --> 01:44:36.037
Take a left turn!

793
01:44:39.879 --> 01:44:41.738
Take a right turn!

794
01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:48.152
Stop!

795
01:46:36.594 --> 01:46:42.292
Oh God! The bus is precariously
placed on a hilltop!

796
01:46:42.715 --> 01:46:43.831
Quiet!

797
01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:56.677
Sit! I am coming.

798
01:47:15.499 --> 01:47:19.612
Come behind!

799
01:47:24.927 --> 01:47:27.314
We got saved!

800
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:32.692
The bus is going to fall in the
valley. Let's Quietly go away.

801
01:47:33.685 --> 01:47:36.420
Hey, where are you going? Sit!

802
01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:42.362
What are you doing?
Why are you tying us?

803
01:48:04.289 --> 01:48:08.222
We got saved! We got
saved a second time!

804
01:48:09.319 --> 01:48:14.092
He is tying the veil. He
is tying everything today!

805
01:48:15.968 --> 01:48:18.042
What is he doing?

806
01:48:18.641 --> 01:48:20.680
Uncle, he is hanging upside down.

807
01:48:21.033 --> 01:48:25.147
I think, he is performing an act
in the circus. But why this way?

808
01:48:36.968 --> 01:48:39.534
We got saved again!

809
01:48:40.345 --> 01:48:42.803
We got saved again!

810
01:48:51.988 --> 01:48:54.830
What are you doing?

811
01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.210
He has freed the girl.
He will free us too.

812
01:49:28.712 --> 01:49:33.173
Raja dear, untie me. God will bless you.

813
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:36.800
I will untie only one of you.

814
01:49:37.154 --> 01:49:39.049
- Me!
- No, me!

815
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:47.246
Quiet!... You decide first.
We'll go for a stroll till then.

816
01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:55.795
- They're gone because of you.
- No, you!

817
01:49:58.576 --> 01:50:00.963
Excuse me... Where does this bus go?

818
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:05.361
- To hell!
- I'll alight a stop earlier.

819
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.906
Hey! Do not board the bus!
Hey blind man, do not board it!

820
01:50:12.295 --> 01:50:14.466
Why shouldn't I? Do you own the bus?

821
01:50:15.179 --> 01:50:17.709
I will certainly travel in it!

822
01:50:18.134 --> 01:50:21.576
Fool! Are you on a swing?

823
01:50:22.708 --> 01:50:29.736
He is not even listening!

824
01:50:32.944 --> 01:50:38.989
- Is this a bus or a boat?
- Come this side!

825
01:51:25.075 --> 01:51:27.989
I think, even God does
not want us to separate.

826
01:51:28.417 --> 01:51:32.039
Fine! Then I will sleep with you.

827
01:59:01.099 --> 01:59:05.249
Do you want to accept one
another as husband and wife?

828
01:59:05.814 --> 01:59:09.328
- Yes.
- Both of you sign here.

829
01:59:10.175 --> 01:59:11.506
Stop!

830
01:59:27.447 --> 01:59:32.544
Brijnath, don't think that I
have come to stop this marriage.

831
01:59:33.251 --> 01:59:37.713
I have no objections
against this marriage now.

832
01:59:40.884 --> 01:59:45.202
I have always wanted
my sister's happiness.

833
01:59:45.774 --> 01:59:47.740
And if she can get that from you,...

834
01:59:48.166 --> 01:59:51.008
... then I shall never be a
barrier between you and her.

835
01:59:51.437 --> 01:59:53.860
Both of you will always
have my blessings.

836
01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:58.962
I have only one reQuest
to make, Brijnath.

837
01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:01.987
I have raised my sister like a daughter.

838
02:00:02.482 --> 02:00:05.672
I had many dreams for her marriage.

839
02:00:06.176 --> 02:00:10.002
If that sister leaves
for her husband's home...

840
02:00:10.432 --> 02:00:11.943
... from her brother's
house, instead of a court...

841
02:00:12.367 --> 02:00:14.825
... then I will be very grateful to you.

842
02:00:18.488 --> 02:00:23.129
It was not our intention to hurt you.

843
02:00:24.256 --> 02:00:28.298
Forget whatever happened.
Your wish is our command.

844
02:00:29.427 --> 02:00:32.089
Madhu's palanQuin will
leave from your house.

845
02:00:33.543 --> 02:00:38.317
I shall never forget your
favor all my life, Brijnath.

846
02:00:42.724 --> 02:00:44.163
Brother!

847
02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:56.677
You bowed at the feet of the
ones unworthy of our kicks?

848
02:00:57.041 --> 02:00:58.060
What's wrong with you?

849
02:00:58.518 --> 02:01:02.344
Do not forget, in order to save
your business from sinking,...

850
02:01:02.775 --> 02:01:05.341
... you have borrowed
millions of rupees from me.

851
02:01:05.799 --> 02:01:08.534
You had promised to
get Madhu married to me.

852
02:01:09.001 --> 02:01:10.296
And if it does not happen so,...

853
02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.890
... then the unthinkable
will happen to you.

854
02:01:14.312 --> 02:01:17.442
Are all of you through?...
Now listen to me.

855
02:01:17.936 --> 02:01:22.397
Do you think, I have accepted
defeat?... No, Vishwa!

856
02:01:22.895 --> 02:01:26.540
I have done this, so that I
can overthrow them completely.

857
02:01:27.433 --> 02:01:30.347
I have disarmed the enemy
by winning his trust.

858
02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.586
Mr. Rana what is all this?

859
02:07:40.055 --> 02:07:43.246
It is only a small token for
the marriage. Please accept it.

860
02:07:44.206 --> 02:07:45.536
No, Mr. Rana.

861
02:07:47.407 --> 02:07:51.976
You have given the
Goddess of your house,...

862
02:07:52.648 --> 02:07:57.913
... your greatest wealth to us.
We do not want anything else.

863
02:07:58.417 --> 02:08:00.695
I am proud of my sister's choice.

864
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:05.199
... who has chosen a home where
the hearts of its people...

865
02:08:05.558 --> 02:08:07.417
... are filled with a wealth
of contentment and culture.

866
02:08:07.774 --> 02:08:09.213
You talk of wealth?

867
02:08:09.638 --> 02:08:13.009
But there are full chances of
me going bankrupt. Greetings!

868
02:08:13.789 --> 02:08:15.467
What's the matter, Ranglani?
You look very worried.

869
02:08:16.814 --> 02:08:19.969
A check of Rs.1 million...

870
02:08:20.332 --> 02:08:20.920
... belonging to the party
at Sitanagar has bounced.

871
02:08:21.352 --> 02:08:24.122
I've telephoned ten time since
morning but nobody answers.

872
02:08:24.554 --> 02:08:26.124
I suspect something fishy.

873
02:08:26.593 --> 02:08:30.071
You will have to go to Sitanagar
by the evening train, Raja.

874
02:08:30.428 --> 02:08:32.706
But I cannot leave my brother alone.

875
02:08:33.101 --> 02:08:34.817
It's a matter of only two days.

876
02:08:36.865 --> 02:08:41.255
Try to understand. There's no
one else to look after brother.

877
02:08:41.684 --> 02:08:45.306
What are you saying,
Raja? Are we not there?

878
02:08:45.659 --> 02:08:48.921
If he stays as a guest at
our house for two days,...

879
02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:52.411
... then we'll get a chance
to be hospitable. Right, Madhu?

880
02:08:53.010 --> 02:08:54.653
- Brother is right.
- But you do not know...

881
02:08:55.016 --> 02:08:58.661
No buts, Raja. Get ready
to leave. Take him, Madhu.

882
02:09:05.745 --> 02:09:11.334
I have cleared your way. Take
the goat and slaughter it.

883
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:26.812
We were waiting for you, Natwar.

884
02:09:27.343 --> 02:09:31.385
Brother, will he be able to
do what we have thought of?

885
02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.558
You cannot trust me? I will
present a small demonstration.

886
02:09:41.343 --> 02:09:44.185
Raja, do not make me angry.

887
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:48.436
If I get angry then,... I will hit you.

888
02:09:48.977 --> 02:09:53.222
Incredible, brother! You
have brought a superb artiste!

889
02:09:54.041 --> 02:09:58.683
Natwar, if you do ourjob
properly, we'll make your life.

890
02:10:01.041 --> 02:10:07.122
But do not forget your limits
because that girl is our sister.

891
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:11.169
Trust me, Mr. Rana.
Your work will be done.

892
02:10:12.333 --> 02:10:15.883
And that madman will land
in the mental hospital.

893
02:10:21.268 --> 02:10:24.458
- What are you doing here?
- I have heard everything.

894
02:10:24.891 --> 02:10:27.517
And I have understood everything.

895
02:10:27.986 --> 02:10:32.028
Your compromise with Birju
the other day was a charade.

896
02:10:32.736 --> 02:10:36.106
But I will not let you
do such a lowly thing!

897
02:10:36.675 --> 02:10:38.750
I shall tell Madhu everything now.

898
02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:42.438
Don't you dare! If
you open your mouth...

899
02:10:43.078 --> 02:10:45.956
- ... then I will leave you!
- No!

900
02:10:46.912 --> 02:10:49.514
Then keep your mouth shut! Understand?

901
02:10:56.057 --> 02:10:59.152
Go to sleep now. Call
me if you need anything.

902
02:11:04.465 --> 02:11:08.639
I am very frightened of lightning.

903
02:11:09.671 --> 02:11:14.876
What's there to be frightened of?
Go to sleep. Nothing will happen.

904
02:11:18.359 --> 02:11:23.732
- Do not leave me!
- Fine. I'll sit here. You sleep.

905
02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:12.819
Who are you?

906
02:13:13.421 --> 02:13:18.027
I... Madhu, I am Birju.

907
02:13:18.767 --> 02:13:23.972
You had me frightened.

908
02:13:24.712 --> 02:13:27.518
What are you doing here?
Go to sleep in your room.

909
02:13:27.948 --> 02:13:31.174
- I am frightened.
- I said, sleep in your room!

910
02:13:31.642 --> 02:13:33.777
I said, I am frightened!

911
02:13:34.878 --> 02:13:38.463
Madhu, I like you very much.

912
02:13:39.662 --> 02:13:44.364
- Birju, what are you doing?
- Come near me.

913
02:13:46.346 --> 02:13:48.061
What are you doing?

914
02:13:48.843 --> 02:13:53.089
I want to touch you once.

915
02:13:54.647 --> 02:14:02.875
I want to touch you.

916
02:14:15.823 --> 02:14:18.977
Brother!... Brother!

917
02:14:22.191 --> 02:14:27.036
Leave me!... Help!

918
02:15:18.156 --> 02:15:23.889
Brother... he...

919
02:15:27.724 --> 02:15:31.478
Swine! You pretended to be crazy...

920
02:15:31.909 --> 02:15:34.932
... and tried to rape
your future sister-in-law!

921
02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.657
I didn't. ... He escaped
from the window. I saved her.

922
02:15:41.056 --> 02:15:44.282
You lie!

923
02:15:44.995 --> 02:15:49.769
Come on, you dog! You pretend!

924
02:15:50.448 --> 02:15:52.654
I shall not spare you alive today!

925
02:15:54.036 --> 02:15:57.442
Swine! You pretend to be crazy!

926
02:15:59.452 --> 02:16:02.823
Do not hit me! I did not do...

927
02:16:07.226 --> 02:16:10.380
Amoral man! You try to rape my sister?

928
02:16:11.131 --> 02:16:12.882
I shall break your hands!

929
02:16:16.654 --> 02:16:18.789
Will you kill him?

930
02:16:19.433 --> 02:16:22.311
Save me!

931
02:16:23.654 --> 02:16:26.844
You pretend, and beg for mercy?

932
02:16:27.663 --> 02:16:31.634
- I beg of you, leave him.
- Move aside!

933
02:16:33.011 --> 02:16:38.000
Brother, telephone the people
in the mental asylum to take him!

934
02:16:40.011 --> 02:16:42.673
Dr. Sinha, this is Rana
Mahindra Pratap speaking.

935
02:16:43.142 --> 02:16:47.351
A madman in my house is beyond
control. Quickly take him away.

936
02:16:47.679 --> 02:16:49.010
I will kill you!

937
02:16:55.488 --> 02:16:58.114
I will not spare you alive!

938
02:16:59.287 --> 02:17:03.461
- Take him away!
- No!

939
02:17:08.151 --> 02:17:13.777
I am not at fault! Do not
send me to the mental hospital!

940
02:17:59.896 --> 02:18:02.703
You're sitting here? I was
looking all over the house for you.

941
02:18:03.133 --> 02:18:06.887
Look, what I've brought for you.

942
02:18:10.273 --> 02:18:12.132
One doesn't get anything at Sitanagar.

943
02:18:12.630 --> 02:18:16.948
Yet, I have brought a shawl for
Mr. Rana and a sweater for brother.

944
02:18:17.344 --> 02:18:19.310
It will look good on him, won't it?

945
02:18:20.192 --> 02:18:21.631
But where is brother Birju?

946
02:18:23.676 --> 02:18:26.337
Madhu, tell me where he is.

947
02:18:33.665 --> 02:18:39.146
Why don't you answer?
Where is brother Birju?

948
02:18:40.736 --> 02:18:42.283
Tell me, where he is.

949
02:18:45.168 --> 02:18:49.666
Why are all of you silent?
Why don't you say where he is?

950
02:18:52.519 --> 02:18:55.145
For God's sake, tell me,
where brother Birju is.

951
02:18:55.826 --> 02:18:56.702
I'll tell you.

952
02:18:57.621 --> 02:19:00.355
Your brother is in
the mental asylum now.

953
02:19:11.269 --> 02:19:15.443
My brother is in the
mental asylum, Madhu?

954
02:19:25.269 --> 02:19:28.675
Who sent him?

955
02:19:36.314 --> 02:19:39.469
Why did you send him to a mental asylum!

956
02:19:39.867 --> 02:19:43.453
His behavior was such.
He tried to rape Madhu.

957
02:19:47.641 --> 02:19:50.555
That is a lie! You accuse my brother!

958
02:19:51.088 --> 02:19:53.931
Say, it is a lie!

959
02:19:59.038 --> 02:20:03.009
You accuse my brother!

960
02:20:06.355 --> 02:20:07.758
Say, it is a lie!

961
02:20:08.078 --> 02:20:10.177
Leave him!

962
02:20:11.174 --> 02:20:15.671
There is truth in every
word that my brother uttered.

963
02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:21.022
People consider their younger
brother's wife as their daughter.

964
02:20:21.621 --> 02:20:24.644
Your brother tried
to rape that daughter!

965
02:20:27.531 --> 02:20:31.045
You... you are saying this, Madhu?

966
02:20:31.822 --> 02:20:37.651
Yes, I am saying it because
I endured that experience!

967
02:20:40.968 --> 02:20:42.971
You are committing a sin...

968
02:20:43.782 --> 02:20:47.788
... by make such cheap
accusations on a helpless man.

969
02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.510
It can rain fire from the skies,
blood can erupt from the land...

970
02:20:53.702 --> 02:21:00.659
But my brother can never do
anything so disgraceful. Never!

971
02:21:01.054 --> 02:21:04.315
There is... there is
certainly a conspiracy.

972
02:21:05.521 --> 02:21:09.383
Don't you dare try to
accuse my noble brothers!

973
02:21:10.306 --> 02:21:12.344
If they hadn't come on
time the other day...

974
02:21:12.838 --> 02:21:15.404
... then I would not have
been able to show you my face!

975
02:21:17.551 --> 02:21:19.794
You will have to decide today, Raja!

976
02:21:20.295 --> 02:21:24.649
Either I, or your mad brother
will stay in your life!

977
02:21:29.406 --> 02:21:32.704
Don't you dare call my brother mad!

978
02:21:33.029 --> 02:21:35.163
As regards my decision...

979
02:21:35.667 --> 02:21:39.421
I can sacrifice a thousand
girls like you for my brother!

980
02:21:41.014 --> 02:21:47.167
Go away! Even I don't want to
maintain any relations with you!

981
02:22:00.396 --> 02:22:03.310
Vishwa, did you see
the wonder of my brains?

982
02:22:04.265 --> 02:22:07.179
The lover has left for good.

983
02:22:07.607 --> 02:22:10.233
And my sister too has returned to me.

984
02:22:26.989 --> 02:22:29.376
Brother Birju!

985
02:23:11.065 --> 02:23:13.236
They will kill me.

986
02:23:14.091 --> 02:23:17.040
Take me home, Raja.

987
02:23:20.809 --> 02:23:24.599
Nothing will happen
to you when I am here.

988
02:23:25.628 --> 02:23:31.289
Raja, I did not try to rape Madhu.

989
02:23:31.573 --> 02:23:34.799
I know, you can never
do anything so cheap.

990
02:23:35.935 --> 02:23:38.142
Those reprobates have cast
this accusation on you.

991
02:23:38.573 --> 02:23:43.106
But now I am back.
Everything will be okay.

992
02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:48.174
Congratulations, sir! I heard,
you've sent Birju to the asylum.

993
02:23:48.704 --> 02:23:53.058
- When will I get my reward?
- You'll certainly get it.

994
02:23:56.407 --> 02:23:57.954
- Swine!
- You, Raja?

995
02:23:58.870 --> 02:24:01.184
You put the blame on my brother?

996
02:24:06.679 --> 02:24:09.101
Tell me, what the truth is!

997
02:24:10.197 --> 02:24:15.426
I will tell, Raja! Leave me!

998
02:24:17.829 --> 02:24:22.603
You will have to say everything
in front of Madhu! Come on!

999
02:24:33.272 --> 02:24:35.623
Give me the keys!

1000
02:24:46.287 --> 02:24:48.566
Driver, start the vehicle.

1001
02:25:10.488 --> 02:25:29.236
Raja, my brother!... Is
anybody here? Come here!

1002
02:25:37.223 --> 02:25:41.049
How dare you barge in! Get out!

1003
02:25:41.655 --> 02:25:44.221
I have some work with
Madhu. My brother...

1004
02:25:46.755 --> 02:25:53.784
Save my Raja, Madhu! He
has met with an accident.

1005
02:25:55.128 --> 02:25:57.694
Save him, Madhu.

1006
02:25:58.082 --> 02:26:01.727
Save him.

1007
02:26:02.795 --> 02:26:07.077
Now I know, why you are here!

1008
02:26:08.671 --> 02:26:12.148
This need pulled you
here, didn't it? Take it!

1009
02:26:12.505 --> 02:26:16.090
You can buy your brother's
life with this! Take it!

1010
02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:25.721
I have not come here for money.

1011
02:26:26.293 --> 02:26:28.500
I have come here to take you.

1012
02:26:28.967 --> 02:26:34.376
Raja wants to see you. He
utters your name, Madhu.

1013
02:26:35.017 --> 02:26:39.934
He loves you. You are his life. Come on.

1014
02:26:40.611 --> 02:26:42.650
Come on. There is very little time.

1015
02:26:43.565 --> 02:26:44.859
Leave my hand!

1016
02:26:45.394 --> 02:26:47.745
I have nothing to do with
the life of a man who...

1017
02:26:48.138 --> 02:26:51.125
... who made me a living dead.

1018
02:26:52.851 --> 02:26:56.329
Our relationship has
ended. Go! Go away!!

1019
02:26:57.777 --> 02:27:00.403
Hey, madman! Didn't you
hear what my sister said?

1020
02:27:00.836 --> 02:27:03.150
Get lost, or I'll break your bones!

1021
02:27:13.852 --> 02:27:17.858
You were the last hope for him.

1022
02:27:18.917 --> 02:27:21.268
Even you turned away.

1023
02:27:25.144 --> 02:27:27.806
Where will I go?

1024
02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:33.090
What will I do?

1025
02:27:35.802 --> 02:27:37.973
My Raja will die.

1026
02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.430
My brother will die.

1027
02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:47.646
My Raja will die.

1028
02:27:59.334 --> 02:28:01.757
Bravo, Madhu!

1029
02:28:02.395 --> 02:28:07.624
You have really done a good
thing by throwing him out of here.

1030
02:28:08.058 --> 02:28:11.740
This is what you should have done.
By doing so, you have proved...

1031
02:28:12.209 --> 02:28:14.139
... that you are their sister.

1032
02:28:14.637 --> 02:28:19.170
Because the dirty blood
that flows in their veins...

1033
02:28:19.561 --> 02:28:21.348
... flows in yours too!

1034
02:28:21.742 --> 02:28:25.148
Are you crazy, Sumitra? What
nonsense are you talking?

1035
02:28:25.541 --> 02:28:28.875
I am only spewing acid, so
that your facade of decency...

1036
02:28:29.305 --> 02:28:33.803
... gets burnt, and she
can see your wicked self.

1037
02:28:34.159 --> 02:28:35.562
Then stop spewing acid,...

1038
02:28:35.988 --> 02:28:40.306
... or it may burn the
thread of your 'Mangalsutra'.

1039
02:28:42.074 --> 02:28:44.425
Since the time, the world was made,...

1040
02:28:44.923 --> 02:28:50.152
... man has always threatened
a woman with this thread.

1041
02:28:50.693 --> 02:28:53.571
While the poor woman
silently endured everything.

1042
02:28:54.033 --> 02:28:57.931
You are threatening me
with this 'Mangalsutra'?

1043
02:28:59.697 --> 02:29:04.051
Then today, I free myself of this bond!

1044
02:29:06.064 --> 02:29:09.362
Now you cannot prevent me
from speaking the truth.

1045
02:29:10.144 --> 02:29:14.918
You don't know, how your brothers
have conspired against you.

1046
02:29:15.386 --> 02:29:19.031
You used to tie a
'rakhi' on their hands.

1047
02:29:19.431 --> 02:29:22.418
They have crushed your
happiness with the same hands!

1048
02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:27.202
If you say a word more, then I
will cut your body into pieces!

1049
02:29:27.628 --> 02:29:30.158
Cut, Mahindra Pratap! Cut!!

1050
02:29:30.617 --> 02:29:33.243
I am sharper than your sword today!

1051
02:29:33.713 --> 02:29:36.135
If you have the guts, then cut me!

1052
02:29:52.039 --> 02:29:55.721
To convert his defeat into victory,...

1053
02:29:56.155 --> 02:29:58.506
... he did fix your marriage with Raja.

1054
02:29:58.969 --> 02:30:01.535
But it was only a charade!

1055
02:30:03.085 --> 02:30:06.982
That night, it wasn't
Birju who tried to rape you.

1056
02:30:07.411 --> 02:30:10.505
But a hired man sent by your brothers!

1057
02:30:12.161 --> 02:30:18.877
That's not all. In order to save
their skin, they tried to kill Raja.

1058
02:30:19.301 --> 02:30:23.055
So that his death would
put an end to your love!

1059
02:31:03.904 --> 02:31:08.366
One day, looking at your
love, I had prayed to God...

1060
02:31:08.829 --> 02:31:12.978
... that I get brothers
like you in every life.

1061
02:31:13.507 --> 02:31:20.188
But looking at your true
colors today, I pray to God...

1062
02:31:20.578 --> 02:31:24.404
... that no sister should be born...

1063
02:31:24.834 --> 02:31:27.857
... in a house where there
are brothers like you.

1064
02:31:33.418 --> 02:31:40.662
And I rejected my love
for brothers like you?

1065
02:31:42.247 --> 02:31:44.982
No... I shall go.

1066
02:31:45.694 --> 02:31:48.753
I shall definitely, go to my Raja.

1067
02:32:02.755 --> 02:32:05.069
You will not step out of here!

1068
02:32:07.187 --> 02:32:10.209
Didn't you hear? You
will not step out of here!

1069
02:32:12.041 --> 02:32:14.607
I will certainly go!

1070
02:32:16.543 --> 02:32:19.602
- Your corpse will leave this home.
- Leave me.

1071
02:32:25.478 --> 02:32:28.284
- Brother?
- Let her go, Vishwa.

1072
02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:30.538
What! Are you in your senses, brother?

1073
02:32:31.001 --> 02:32:34.407
Yes. I have come to my senses today.

1074
02:32:35.187 --> 02:32:37.717
My Sumitra has opened my eyes.

1075
02:32:38.107 --> 02:32:41.825
And made me realize
every mistake of mine.

1076
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:44.604
Let her go, Vishwa.

1077
02:32:45.107 --> 02:32:49.604
You may concede defeat. But
I won't bow before her wishes.

1078
02:32:50.383 --> 02:32:52.278
- I won't let her go!
- No, Vishwa!

1079
02:32:53.338 --> 02:32:56.492
Don't you dare stop her! Leave her!

1080
02:33:00.091 --> 02:33:05.225
Go, Madhu! Go far away from
the lives of selfish brothers.

1081
02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:08.034
And never return.

1082
02:33:10.574 --> 02:33:12.216
Go and settle down.

1083
02:33:12.650 --> 02:33:16.691
My blessings are with you. Go, dear.

1084
02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:32.375
No!

1085
02:33:34.987 --> 02:33:37.157
Brother!

1086
02:33:39.454 --> 02:33:41.133
You were going, weren't you? Now go!

1087
02:33:42.971 --> 02:33:47.013
I will definitely go to my
Raja. Shoot me too if you wish!

1088
02:33:47.334 --> 02:33:50.488
No. I will not kill you.

1089
02:33:50.887 --> 02:33:55.312
But I shall wipe that
swine's name off...

1090
02:33:55.671 --> 02:33:56.929
... from your heart and mind!

1091
02:33:57.218 --> 02:33:59.880
Try. You will be unsuccessful.

1092
02:34:00.314 --> 02:34:01.992
You challenge me!

1093
02:34:04.887 --> 02:34:06.038
Now take his name!

1094
02:34:12.168 --> 02:34:14.027
- Vishwa, leave her!
- Move aside!

1095
02:34:15.334 --> 02:34:17.433
I shall say a thousand times.

1096
02:34:25.606 --> 02:34:27.152
I will not spare you!

1097
02:34:27.856 --> 02:34:31.646
I will leave you incapable
of uttering your lover's name!

1098
02:34:32.112 --> 02:34:33.935
God hasn't made man so
strong, that he can break...

1099
02:34:34.329 --> 02:34:37.807
... a woman's determination.
You'll also see the truth today!

1100
02:34:39.430 --> 02:34:40.581
You back-answer!

1101
02:35:08.872 --> 02:35:12.170
Say now! Will you take his name?

1102
02:35:16.013 --> 02:35:18.783
Kill me if you wish...

1103
02:35:19.179 --> 02:35:21.877
...by slicing me into tiny pieces.

1104
02:35:22.310 --> 02:35:27.971
Even the drops of my blood
will utter only his name!

1105
02:35:53.898 --> 02:35:55.864
No!

1106
02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:02.260
That swine's love flows
in your veins like blood!

1107
02:36:02.692 --> 02:36:06.698
Today, I shall burn that body!

1108
02:36:08.179 --> 02:36:14.824
- I shall burn it!
- No!

1109
02:36:19.330 --> 02:36:19.641
Scoundrel!

1110
02:36:43.742 --> 02:36:47.040
You hit Madhu, you swine?

1111
02:37:08.999 --> 02:37:18.138
No!... What are you doing?

1112
02:37:18.637 --> 02:37:22.786
Raja, no! No!!

1113
02:37:44.843 --> 02:37:46.354
What are you looking at?

1114
02:37:47.728 --> 02:37:54.301
The girl is here, there's fire,
and it's the 25th of October today.

1115
02:37:55.959 --> 02:37:59.089
Take the nuptial rounds.

1116
02:38:16.643 --> 02:38:19.630
It is the elder brother's
right to tie this knot.

1117
02:38:23.396 --> 02:38:25.531
No, brother! No!

1118
02:39:12.221 --> 02:39:18.866
Help! Save me!

1119
02:39:19.221 --> 02:39:22.315
This is your punishment.
Nobody is going to save you.

1120
02:39:22.634 --> 02:39:27.551
His death is not our aim. His
repentance will be our victory.

1121
02:39:46.764 --> 02:39:52.209
Look! He has forgiven you
inspite of your atrocities.

1122
02:39:52.709 --> 02:39:54.256
Now get up and seek his forgiveness.

1123
02:39:56.966 --> 02:39:59.424
Forgive me.

1124
02:39:59.815 --> 02:40:05.019
Brijnath, I have also been
unjust to you. Forgive me too.

1125
02:40:05.514 --> 02:40:09.832
Today, I believe that
marriages are made in heaven.

1126
02:40:10.227 --> 02:40:14.125
No power on earth can break it.

1127
02:40:32.142 --> 02:40:37.371
I will not let you
celebrate your honeymoon.

1128
02:40:40.057 --> 02:40:43.354
I have escaped from the
asylum a second time.

1129
02:40:43.786 --> 02:40:45.501
At least tell me now,
what the matter was.

1130
02:40:46.107 --> 02:40:49.549
- Come here.
- Tell me Quickly.

1131
02:40:50.223 --> 02:40:51.626
I beg of you...

1132
02:40:52.263 --> 02:40:56.617
Please tell me, what the matter was.

1133
02:40:56.976 --> 02:40:58.307
Alright. Well...

1134
02:40:58.735 --> 02:41:04.708
- Never mind. You'll get angry.
- I do not get angry!

1135
02:41:05.418 --> 02:41:10.623
- Okay. I'll ask my husband.
- Ask anyone, but tell me!

1136
02:41:10.942 --> 02:41:13.472
Raja, he is crazy. Speed
away when you get the chance.

1137
02:41:14.987 --> 02:41:16.354
Well...

1138
02:41:28.248 --> 02:41:32.457
Dishonest woman! You deceived me again!

1139
02:41:34.474 --> 02:41:35.697
Where are all of you going?

1140
02:41:36.198 --> 02:41:39.004
At least, you tell me,
what the matter was.

1141
02:41:39.469 --> 02:41:42.804
I will not get angry!
